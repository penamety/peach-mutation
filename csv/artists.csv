94,Bart Roijmans,,nl,,,,"Bart Roijmans is a freelance sound designer with over 16 years of experience in composing soundtracks for computergames on various platforms. Besides a composer, he's also an experienced voice actor and sound effect designer.

Early 1990, Roijmans began composing music for games and graphic demos for the MSX system as a hobby. Through mutual friends he got acquainted with his current employer Engine Software, who were also active in the MSX-scene at that time. In 1992 he finished his first game soundtrack for a non-commercial project.

Not particularly looking for a job in the games-industry he went to college studying computer science. Meanwhile Engine Software turned professional in 1995, and was still looking for a sound designer. After his graduation in 1999 Roijmans joined the Engine Software team, and has been working there ever since. He has worked on the soundtracks of virtually every Engine Software title on PC/CD-ROM, Smartphone, Pocket-PC, SNES, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii and Sony PSP. Covering many game genres as well as musical styles.

In 2006 he started working as a parttime freelancer on soundtracks for Nintendo DS games, as well as the audio post production of large localization projects.

Besides being a dedicated composer, Roijmans is also a passionate gamer. This combined with his extensive work experience gives him insight on what the publisher or end-user wants to hear.",1,0

110,Ben Daglish,Derbyshire,gb,,,,"Ben Daglish (born 1966 in London, United Kingdom) is a composer and musician. Originally from London, his parents moved to the steel city of Sheffield when Ben was one. Daglish is known for creating many soundtracks during the 1980s for home computer games, including such Commodore 64 hits as The Last Ninja, Trap, and Deflektor. Daglish teamed up with fellow C64 musician and prolific programmer, Tony Crowther, forming W.E.M.U.S.I.C., which stood for ""We Make Use of Sound In Computers"".

Daglish lives in Derbyshire where he still composes, plays and performs in a number of UK bands, including Loscoe State Opera. He also regularly performs with violinist madfiddler and the band SID80s at retro computer game events such as Back In Time Live and Retrovision. He has also performed with Commodore 64 revival band PRESS PLAY ON TAPE together with Rob Hubbard. He is a fan of the late Ronnie Hazlehurst, a prolific composer for TV.

David is renowned in the field of music composition and programming thanks to his work with some of the biggest names in the video game industry from the 80s and 90s. He is a musician, singer and songwriter in his own right and has been a professional live musician since the age of 15.

Holly is a professional pianist and singer and also works as a session singer and musician on a variety of professional projects.

She can always be found behind a keyboard or a mixing desk, trying out new ideas and fresh musical interpretations.

David and Holly work closely together in composition, arrangement and production. Between them they cover almost every type of instrument and style.

His work as a composer, sound designer as well as music and audio producer has left a memorable mark in many productions and independent projects. As a side dish, Ari’s experience in game producer, designer and concept writer comes in handy along with the slick skill to produce design for trailers and in-game cinematics, including vocal directing.

The Finnish demoscene and mod tracker background was fundamental to Ari’s work. After the years of making music just as a hobby, he was hired to Frozenbyte Inc. in 2003 to make his first commercial product, Shadowgrounds (PC) game (2005) sound design and Original Soundtrack which became an instant cult classic for many gamers. For the educational point of view, diplomas in Professional audio design and producing, Further Education for Producers and Leads of the Finnish Game Industry with Adulta and Music Technology with high valued finnish institution, Sibelius Academy are the proof of talent in black and white.

The actual professional quantum leap for Ari was his five year long career as an in-house Audio Director with Frozenbyte, Inc. working as composer, sound designer and even a writer & designer with the games like Jack Claw Demo (Multiplatform) and Shadowgrounds Survivor (PC/2007) and outsourced to make the highly popular Super Stardust HD (PS3/2007). Now after 8 years of professional work in game industry, Ari has been making games likeTrine (PS3/PC), Angry Birds franchise (multiplatform), Dead Nation (PS3), Outland (PS3/360) and Bike Baron. Ari’s recently published games are Trine 2, Super Stardust Delta, Trine 2 The Goblin Menace and Angry Birds Trilogy and the latest one Resogun for PS4. These games have received rave reviews and praise for their soundtracks and sound design. Ari is currently working with various games and other really interesting projects.",1,0

""Now, please promise not to laugh... My first handle was in fact Wolfman. Yeah, I know it sounds pretty lame but I guess I'm excused since I was only 11-12 years when I took it. My brother Ole (Pet) is still teasing me with it! I later changed my handle to Drax which isn't much better, but who cares? I have had that handle since 1988-89 and it was Tiger of Noise who suggested it, I guess I just thought: ""Yeah, hmmm... why not?""

Trivia :
Thomas started making music on the C64 in 1988. He joined Vibrants in 1989 as the third member, and immediately started using JCH music-editor V2.53. He composed almost 1000 tunes on the C64 alone, but he has also composed music for other computer formats. In 1996, he joined Maniacs of Noise.

""My brother Ole, being a total computer geek, have definitely influenced me - yeah, that's right, I blame it on you, thank you very much! ;) I remember him programming demos, making graphics, composing music and also some swapping. The music-making especially caught my attention and I started trying out Soundmonitor V1.0 and Rob Hubbard's player in a monitor. I still wonder where my tunes in Hubbard's driver are. My brother was a member of a local group together with Tiger and he played some of my music and Tiger was pleasantly surprised and told me that Bones was looking for a musician. I then sent some music to Max/Bones, he liked it and asked me to join - and I did. Later I joined Noise and after that several other groups.""

""My proudest moment was when I joined Maniacs of Noise. Jeroen Tel contacted me in 1996 and asked if I was interested in being a MoN member. Since MoN was my absolute favourite group, I didn't hesitate for a moment and joined.""

I knew I must hear everything from him and he soon became a favorite of mine. The more I downloaded and heard the more I was surprised about his kind of arrangements, melodies and expression in his electro music. I hope you all enjoy the songs like I do. They're not all easy to listen. Some of them are really deeply sad/melancholic/moody. Often they need to be listened more than 1 time. If you let yourself drown in them, you never will have missed one of his songs.

I was born in 1982, and became fascinated by technology early enough to witness the breathtaking, ongoing revolution that began when homecomputers became affordable. The first machine I laid my hands on was a C116, and then a C64 on which I wrote my first BASIC-Programs (but my interesting BASIC-Programs I wrote on an Atari 1040 STE).

(...)

I came into contact with ""modern music production"" as soon as there were sufficiently powerful computers around. While I had my first tries with computer-aided music-production with my Atari and a MIDI-Capable electric piano, things became really interesting when I had my first AWE32...

(...)

Simply put, I'm totally stunned by the creative possibilities that come with my current equipment.

You might have noticed that I did not actually tell anything personal about myself, nothing which explains why I do what I do. As to that, I could write much for sure, but I would never regard it as true. I believe the answer to why I do what I do lies somewhere within what I do. But of course, you may always ask me about my intentions :)""

715,Maestro,Skanderborg,dk,,Martin de Agger,,"In the memories of a Maestro

Friday the 14th of June 1996, an old amiga musician, Martin ""Maestro"" Agger had an heart attack and died in Aarhus, Denmark, 24 years old.

Martin was welknown back in 1988-1992 for the great modules he composed for demos and games. He produced his best pieces for groups like Kefrens, Flash Production and Anarchy.

Today Martin will be remembered for the great mind he had, and the openminded approach he had towards everything. Martin was the kind of friend, who always helped you up when you were down, and celebrated with you, when back on the top. And thats why, he will be so awfully missed by his friends, his girlfriend and the family.

The last couple of years, Martin started working alot with 3D modelling, and he had a great talent for that too. Just 2 months before his tragic death, he started as a computer modeller at the Danish national television, DR, which ofcourse made both him and us very proud.

As an end, I can only say how sorry I am, that you are not among us anymore, Martin.

From your friend, who will miss you forever ...

Eric Gieseke, also known as Sidewinder and DJ Spankinspock, is a musician from Boston, USA. He started on his musical journey in the 80s by entering the tracker scene, producing modules using ProTracker for the Amiga. He had several releases through groups like Megawatts, Porphyria and InfoCorner, until he withdrew from the scene in the mid 90s. Going from techno, rave and latin-inspired breaks, to house and even a few jazzy tunes, his music comprehends a vast variety of styles and is defined as playful and melodic with a true spirit.

In March 1994 he released his debut album, Future Shock 2, a 100% Amiga recorded album produced in a professional studio during the last quarter of 1993. It also features a bonus track from the popular Amiga game, Scorched Tanks, remixed in CD quality.

After leaving the Amiga scene and going back underground, Sidewinder made a pop-up entrance by the millennium shift with the release of a second album in 1999, 2badsheep. This release featured 19 of his later recordings, making a blend of tracked modules and newly recorded tracks. And as one would expect of Sidewinder, all in a twisted variety of styles with jamming melodies.

Some of his unreleased tracks from the late 90’s can be downloaded for free at his official website, www.2badsheep.com.",1,0

Greetings! I’m Ariel. I have a wife and two kids, and they are the loves of my life and my best friends. I like to compose music and experiment with sound. I like to draw, whether it’s pen and paper or pixel art, it doesn’t really matter. I like playing games and I like making games. I like reading and writing. I like listening to music with my eyes closed. I like closing my eyes in general. I like… you? Contact me.

I learned how to compose music using trackers in the early 90’s by hanging out in the demoscene. In 1996, my involvement with an ANSI art group, ACiD, landed me my first video game music composition and sound design gig with Webfoot Games. I worked for Webfoot for many years. I worked on lots of casual PC games and a Dragon Ball Z title for the Game Boy Advance. Loved every minute.

I’m currently Audio Director at QC Games. Before that, I was a producer at BioWare. Before that, I was at Volition in the role of Studio Audio Director. Building a career in game development has been a challenge for the ages, but it has been worth it. It has consistently surrounded me with brilliant and talented people, and I’d like that to continue. So maybe you should get in touch?",1,0

my name´s Dennis and i am from germany.

Born in 1975, i was going the ""usual"" way: C=64 -> Amiga 500 -> IBM 386 DX2 / 66 ...and all the way, music & grafix were my air to breeze... Too bad that i haven´t organized & archived my work earlier -.- Most of the gfx and sounds got lost during moving. Only some cassettes with music from the Amiga times are left.

Since i was using the PC for audio production, (nearly) all MP3s got stored...only some project-files got lost during a HDD-crash:-( So if i want to change something, i have to re-create these traxx.

See ya / hear ya ^^

He has a strong passion of Nintendo products, and especially for using them in ways they were not originally intended for. Nothing naughty, though, just writing and using homebrew, and using them to write and perform even more electronic music.

After living in both Ecuador and Norway for a while (not at once, though), he works influences of lots of artists from those places, as well as influences from the Austrian scenes into his music.

The style of nexxyz’ music ranges from Chiptune-y over Technoid to Breakbeaty and Orchestral. While he usually writes original tunes, he once in a while also enjoys giving a tune written by someone else a new face by producing his own cover.

In his more or less real life he works in the field of computer science and testing. His hobbies include, but are not limited to:
 Writing music, games, watching movies, martial arts, cooking, reading, smart-assing, crashing radio controlled vehicles and being with his girlfriend.

1598,Yerzmyey,Kraków,pl,,,,"I started to make chiptunes on ZX Spectrum computer, in 1989. ZX Spectrum 48K has 1-bit sound by default, but one can also connect an AY-interface to the machine (existing since its very beginning in 1982 and even earlier because first AY-interfaces have been built for ZX81 computer - 1981).

Anyway - then Spectrum48 has the same sound-abilities what Spectrum128, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST or MSX have (they use the same chip standard: AY/YM). It means 4-bit sound, 3 channels + white noise generator, square wave and several 'buzzers'. Or - instead of it - I can use 3 channels of 4-bit digital sound with the AY, but then I have to fit all samples in 48Kb of RAM. :)

In case of chip-music, as ""standard capabilities"" I understand AY/YM working in 50hz (Atari ST can use this chip with 200hz of speed which gives the Atarians better audio effects due to their more powerful CPU - 16-bit, 8MHz. Cry cry!!).
So that's my weapon of choice: ZX Spectrum 48K with AY-interface.

For making chiptunes I use ZX Spectrum's Sound-Tracker 1.1 and for digital MOD-like music I use SampleTracker 2.0 and 2.1.

In 1994 I started to make music also for Amiga 500 (MOD / MED files) on OctaMED, but they were 4 channels traxx mostly - in 99%. :) We made only several 8 channels tracks on OctaMED but it was pretty hard task for old good A500, so usually I stick with 4ch. :)

In 2002 I founded AY-RIDERS band. We play chiptunes on our Spectrums (48K, 128K and higher models). AY-RIDERS' music can be found here: ay-riders.speccy.cz/ (My own music You can find here: yerzmyey.i-demo.pl/ ).

Some time later I started to make more music for Atari ST and STe (mostly digital, but also some chiptunes).
That's how the YM-DIGITAL band appeared in 2010: ym-digital.i-demo.pl/ - there are 2 albums for all enthusiasts of ym2149 chip and digital oldschool music.

In 2012 I bought an Amiga 1200 and was able to start making full 8-channels digital songs for the platform (with independent volumes). That's how the ""RetroBeat"" album appeared, for all fans of Amiga, and also for fans of retro-computer-music.

From time to time I make songs for Atari Falcon 030 (10 channels of digital music, on DHS-Tracker).

In 2015 I bought a British microcomputer Raspberry Pi 2 (smaller than the human hand-palm :) ), and I make some music on it, too.

So, in short, my software/hardware usually are: 
SoundTracker on ZX81;
E-Tracker on SAM Coupe computer (Spectrum Advanced Machine);
MusicMon on ATARI 520ST;
DigiComposer on ATARI 520ST;
ProTracker on ATARI 520 ST;
Hex-Tracker on ATARI 520ST;
Octalyser on ATARI 1040 STE;
OctaMED on AMIGA 500;
DigiBooster on AMIGA 1200;
Digital Home Studio (DHS-Tracker) on ATARI Falcon 030
MilkyTracker on Raspberry Pi

1611,Zyron,Karlsborg,se,,Johan Åstrand,,"""Zyron is a schooldance DJ from the 80's, who unlike many DJs of today know the craftsmanship from a very basic level. He comes from the times when DJ was not something you wanted to become, you were just chosen to be it, because you had the records and the talent. His knowledge of music from the past is extremely vast, and unlike many other underground DJs he isn't snobbish and doesn't shun pop.

His mixing style is smooth and organic like a living snake, and most of the time you can be sure you're in for a dreamy mystical journey of some kind, organic or robotic and everything inbetween. And somewhere inside this cosmic mess, you can hear the signs of a disturbed c64 scener who's been listening to way too much Depeche Mode.

The most special trademark though is Zyron's unusual (dis)harmonic touch, which somehow pierces through not just the DJ mixes but his own music productions, not to mention all the SID music he has produced in the past. I don't know if this is his selection, pitch settings, or if Martin Gore did something to Zyron as a boy, but it's unimitable. No other DJ sounds like that.""

I also use the Commodore 64 with SID sound synthesizer for chiptunes. I did also some Gameboy tracks as well as Atari XL/XE, Atari ST (on YM chip), Amstrad/Schneider CPC (AY chip) and sampled tracks on Amiga. Having experiences on AY Riders' concerts I sometimes do live chiptune gigs, usually playing the chiptunes from the real hardware and eventually jamming to them on old electronic toy-keyboards or other 8-bit computers.

My software/hardware usually are:
- SQ-Tracker on ZX Spectrum 128 (AY)
- Beepola on ZX Spectrum 48 (1-bit)
- TFX 2.8 on Commodore 64 (SID)
- Raster Music Tracker on Atari XL/XE (POKEY)

- MusicMon on Atari 520ST+ (YM - chiptunes)
- ProTracker on Amiga 1200/600/500 (PAULA)

If you organize a chiptune concert, let me know. I'm operating mostly in Prague, CZ. I can make about 30-60 minutes chiptunes show using real 8-bit/16-bit machines (no emulation) + some keyboard instrument jamming. Your own audio system+cables, ev. VJ system is needed (I can provide a video file with 8-bit ZX Spectrum graphical content for a VJ purposes).

1745,Cdnalsi,,ro,,Sebastian Spanache,,"At age 24, Sebastian Spanache is one of the leaders of the next generation of up-and-coming jazz musicians in the Romanian music scene. Having performed on stages be it Romanian and International Jazz festivals, club gigs or personal projects, he always adds a fresh sound to a solid performance.

Sebastian started his musical journey in his home town Timisoara, Romania where he began playing the piano at age 5 and then took up the study of jazz in ninth grade while attending the National College of Arts Ion Vidu. While still studying classical piano in high school, Sebastian founded his first Jazz/Funk band later to have gigged all over Romania and win numerous prizes at student competitions.
After graduating college, he started shifting his playing and compositional directions towards a more modern edge with Latin Jazz and Funk projects and gigs. While attending the National Conservatory of Timisoara, Sebastian also attended the first Jazz-Pop faculty in central-eastern Europe, the Richard Oschanitzky Faculty of Tibiscus University.

Sebastian has had the opportunity to play with some of the most influential Jazz musicians from Romania and abroad, and is currently pursuing the stage life of cruise ship gigging. On the East Coast of the U.S. from New York to Miami and The Bahamas, Sebastian has had several cruise ship contracts to add to his musical experience. Meeting, learning and playing with some of the most promising young musicians of the U.S., Canada, international and from the New York music scene.
Sebastian is also working on personal projects like the Merry Jazzy Christmas ‘07 CD featuring rearranged Christmas carols with a twist, along side saxophonist Lucian Nagy. His latest project, Standards, still a work in progress, is actually an effort to come back to traditional Jazz while keeping the modern feel of his playing style. Sebastian is also writing for a new trio project featuring James Cook on electric bass and Jeff Tétrault on drums.

Sebastian also writes music for motion pictures and video games, having projects that range from 3D Demoscene shorts like 195/95 by Plastic, PL, which won grand prize at Breakpoint Festival in Germany to freeware platform games like Within a Deep Forest and Knytt by Nicklas (Nifflas) Nygren. The games were featured on speciality websites such as JayIsGames and Gamespot.

Sebastian is an open-minded and versatile musician who is always ready to add his fiery style of playing to any musical situation.",1,0

A full copy below:

In remembrance of Edwin van Santen
Hi everyone.

I don't know if many of you remember me, but Edwin and I founded 20th century composers (20cc) way back in 1988 or so. I’ve been asked to write an article focusing on Edwin’s work in 20CC, and I gladly accepted the opportunity to write about my memories of Edwin. So I’ve fired up the old SID browser and started up some of Edwin’s tracks - hoping all the good memories come back to me!

Back in ’87 or so I developed a first crude version of the “music player” code (although most ideas were initially ripped from the existing Hubbard / MON players). Off course, just a player is not much use just by itself, and I was thus actively looking for someone that had some real musical talent (not having met Edwin yet). I can’t remember where and how I met Edwin, but it must have been at some copy party. Even though we had a small age gap (I was seventeen, Edwin fourteen) we immediately aligned and shared the same vision as how to proceed onwards.

As the player at that point still had a lot of rough edges (as did our SID knowledge), we decided just to start doing demo tunes and learn as we proceeded. Any careful listener can certainly hear the “crude” technology we had in the early days (just listen to one of our early tracks such as “Dolphin Force”). However, we worked hard, and did a lot of analysis on other tunes and players, and we made great progress. If you listen to “I’m your baby tonight” or “Layla mix” (both late ’88) then you will immediately notice the huge sound quality improvements we made in that first year. A special worthnoty track mentioning from these early days is the “PCW tune”, which was a huge hit in the scene. It was part of a compilation demo in order to promote ourselves among game producers on the 1988 London PCW show.

From 1990 onwards we had the player on a very mature level, giving us ample capabilities to unleash our creativity. At that point the code had evolved from a plain rip to a program in which we had implemented a lot of our own ideas and vision (including sample playing, double speed playing, dynamic envelopes & range, auto swing, humanizing and more). Just listen to tracks such as “Scratching Zwaantjes” (’90) – the sound quality is awesome. I don’t think it gets a lot better on a SID.

Overall, Edwin was the main composer, and it was my job to concentrate on the technical bits and pieces (mostly improving the music player). I was also in charge of the end mixing and sound design (though I did publish some tracks of my own).

I quit the “active” scene somewhere in 1991 or so, but Edwin continued for a few more years and exited at around 1995. Listening to a track such as “Fire intro” (’93) you can definitely hear the huge improvements Edwin had made in his composing, especially when compared to some of his early tracks. Amazing how much someone can accomplish in just a few years! You’ve got to remember that Edwin had no formal musical teaching. He was basically self thought (apart from some elementary guitar playing skills he had). However, one has to note that a lot of Edwin’s family members were very musical as well. The apple apparently does not fall very far from its tree!

So let’s go back a bit in time once again, and see how 20CC evolved. Our “strategy” was to partly partner/align with well known demo/cracking groups (supplying them with exclusive tracks), and partly to release music on our own “label”. We most certainly wanted to do game music in order to make some cash and widen the audience. Unfortunally, our efforts in obtaining contracts for game music development were obstructed due to major constraints such as school, parental objections and lack of investment power ($$).

Some well known / successful tunes we released in the early years were conversions from popular mainstream tracks such as “Air wolf”, “Big Fun”, “Blue Monday”, “Children Songs V2”, “Popcorn” and off course the much used “Top 40 Mega mix” (all tunes originating from 1988).

Since the conversions were fun to do, and got used a lot in demo’s (boosting our fame), we decided to release a few mainstream conversions every year. This strategy seemed to work quite well for us, as we got a lot of positive feedback on these tracks (and many conversion requests). Well known releases were “Spykerhoek” (1989), “Final Axel”, “Take on me”, “I just don’t have the heart”, “Groove is in da heart” (all 1990), “Killer” (1991), “All that she wants” (1992), “Talentar bells” (aka Tubular Bells) and “This is your life” (both 1993). Another hit conversion was the Mega Mix II track, a mix of famous C64 tunes (’89).
If you have a spare minute, do play “Groove is in da heart” - as I think this could actually be the very best conversion ever made on a C64!

But it certainly wasn’t just conversions that we did. Some of Edwin’s best work (in my humble opinion) is to be found in tracks such as “Eternal”, “Revolution” (both ’89), “Edwin’s dream”, “Just Cool” (both ’90), “Cosmic Cyclon” (’91), “Roodkapje” (’93), “A trip into EV Space” (’94) and the before mentioned “Fire Intro”. Some of my personal favorites are “Learn it the hard way” (’90) and “Paradise” (’91) – both contain exceptional compositional work, and are very typical for his “melodic style”. My personal ever favorite track is “Somewhere Minor”, a composition in a minor scale done in 1990. The underlying chord progressions are wonderful, and the intro is extremely powerful (and again a typical signature of Edwin’s melodic movements). Looking back, it’s my personal opinion that the compositions he did in minor tone scales were among his best. Too bad there aren't many remakes of his work (see remix.kwed.org). Much of his work is definitely worth remixing…

An especially remarkable tune is the “Vlindertjes” track, an absolutely great track that was originally composed in 1988 for the PCW show demo pack. The disk with this track was stolen from Edwin on some copy party shortly after the PCW show. The tune became very well known, as it was used extensively in the “Papillion” intros - albeit in a copycat version by another author! The melody in the Papillion intro is almost identical to Edwin’s track. There is also a later remake (using a different sound set) called “Vlindertjes V2” by Edwin, done in 1990 just for fun.

A good example of our partnering with demo groups is the “Sophisticated III” series of tracks. This set of seven (!) tunes was exclusively composed for the Blackmail demo group. The Sophisticated III demo had a huge impact in the scene due to the powerful combination of new coding techniques (FLI), superb graphics and music. There is also a unique loader track (with samples) where the ‘user’ may mix the tune too its own liking.

Something not many people know is that I also worked extensively with Reyn Ouwehand (as Reyn lived very close to me). Reyn used the 20CC player (with my explicit approval) and I editted a lot of his work. I hoped Reyn would one day join 20CC, but Edwin wasn’t to crazy about this idea. Reyn was the superior composer of the two (with many years of formal training and a very impressive studio), so I could understand that Edwin felt a bit threatened by Reyn… It certainly meant I had to carefully maneuver between the two talents!
An interesting (though also not well known) fact is that certain sound sets I created initially for Reyn were later used by Edwin in his tunes. As an example, listen to the striking resemblance between sounds and effects in Reyn’s “Super Trucker” (’91) and Edwin’s “Retteket” (same year). Edwin used the almost identical sound set I had initially developed for Reyn’s work on the Super Trucker game. Off course Reyn also used some of the sound sets I had initially created for Edwin…

After Edwin quit the C64 scene he became a DJ / producer, mainly focusing on (hardcore) house music, working under the synonym “DJ Perpetrator”. He co-formed the “Floor Control” company, hosting four (vinyl) labels and different artists. Check out http://www.floorcontrol.com for a good overview of his later work. Some well known vinyl releases by Edwin are “Maniacs”, “The power”, “Ill Behavior”, “The Strong Survive”, “Store & Forward”, “World of Shit”, “Arena Creations”, “Come and Test Me” and “The DJ rocks”. Other highly rated releases are “Pumpin’ Correctly “, “Push em up” and “Pumpinfinity”. It’s fair to say that Edwin is generally considered one of the better early (hardcore) house producers.

I learned about Edwin’s passing in the midst of june 2006. As I knew Edwin so well (teaming together to spread the 20CC sound) the news came as quite a shock to me. Edwin had most certainly been a good friend for many years. Although I lost contact with Edwin after ""growing up"", it's hard to forget him. He was a very extravert personality with a cheeky sense of humor - there was always a good laugh when you were hanging out with Edwin.

He would often call by phone just to let me hear a new tune he had been working on during the day (no email in these early days)! I can still envision the weird looks on the face of my mom when she heard the weird high pitched sounds coming from the phone! But it was quite common in these days, as Edwin always wanted to know how I felt about a tune.

I can also vividly remember the many times that we were just sitting together with a little ""mini keys"" keyboard (a simple four octave kid thingy - we didn't have the cash to buy pro tools in the beginning years). Even though we had no proper gear to work with, you could still really hear the talent that he had. As said, most of the musical knowledge he had was self taught. Just imagine what would have been possible would he have had full ""formal"" musical training!

Anyway, I still like to listen to his work nowadays, and not only because of sentimental reasons. Certainly, some tunes are stronger than others, but there is some very powerful material out there. I guess we may now consider this work his ""heritage"" to the scene. We should remember Edwin as a talented composer that has done so much for the progression of C64 music. Too bad he had to leave us at this young age.

My thoughts are with his family and all his many (old and new) friends.

So I browsed the net and found several trackers, including Fasttracker ]|[, later Sk@le, Madttracker 2 and even Modplug! But either they where incomplete, buggy or simply did not fit my taste, especially Madtracker ][ and ModPlug because of the dreaded Windows GIU! *shivers*

Later on I stumbled upon Renoise!! And man, was I ever taken by surprise! So BEAUTIFUL, so easy to use! No crappy windows GUI, just that wonderful old DOS-feeling! The DSPs, multiple tracks on one channel etc etc... Ahhh... Never looked back!

2090,Lamb,Poznań,pl,,Filip Skutela,,"

Filip Skutela (born 1984 in Poznań, Poland) is a contemporary classical music composer, producer and a pianist. Although he had never attended any music classes or formal music education, he realized his passion for music in early childhood. Having absolute pitch, he taught himself about music theory and harmony, and composed his first music piece at the age of nine. He is self-trained pianist as well.

Being focused mainly on orchestral forms of music, he has created pieces in wide variety of classical genres; however, his compositional style represents mostly a form of neo-romanticism. During the years, Skutela evolved his own individual aesthetics and stylistics, which were being mostly described as ""longingly passionate"".

Until this time Skutela has composed three full-time symphonies (No.1 in A major - ""Spring Fireblossom""; No.2 in C# minor - ""Moonfae""; No.3 in Eb minor - ""The Black Key""), two piano concertos (No.1 in E major; No.2 in B minor), two cello concertos (No.1 in E minor; No. 2 in D minor), several string quintets and quartets, of which the most notable is ""Five Elements"", as well as about 200 pieces for solo instruments, mostly piano and cello.

For many years Skutela was connected with Academy of Music in Poznań as an independent artist and performer; also collaborating with Students' Interfacultative Symphony Orchestra. He is also co-founder and conductor of Aave Chamber Orchestra as well as co-founder and musical director of Academic Choir at University of Economics and Computer Science in Warsaw.

After winning several composition contests in 2004-2007, he became more recognized among music community and branched out into composing soundtrack scores for short-subject movies (e.g. ""Synninpäästö"", ""Menneisyys"" directed by Vuokko Salminen), theatre musical settings and other forms of art.

At the moment, he lives in Poznań and works as music composer and psychologist-therapist (having MA degree in Psychology).

After growing up with the demoscene, trackers and chipmusic (and growing bored of playing bass in angry teenage metal bands), he finally started to release his tracked music in chipdisks and demos with the likes of CoolPhat, BDSE, Swedish megastars Up Rough and the mysterious Eunoia.

Syphus plays regular live sets in his hometown of Newcastle - the chip music capital of the UK - and has toured twice with Sabrepulse and the Chiptune Alliance.

2234,ArtZ,Helsinki,fi,,Ari Pulkkinen,,"As a music and audio professional, Ari Pulkkinen has gained the deep knowledge and specialized in the field of music and sound design in game industry. His work as a composer, sound designer as well as music and audio producer has left a memorable mark in many productions and independent projects. As a side dish, Ari’s experience in game producer, designer and concept writer comes in handy along with the slick skill to produce design for trailers and in-game cinematics, including vocal directing.

The Finnish demoscene and mod tracker background was fundamental to Ari’s work. After the years of making music just as a hobby, he was hired to Frozenbyte Inc. in 2003 to make his first commercial product, Shadowgrounds (PC) game (2005) sound design and Original Soundtrack which became an instant cult classic for many gamers. For the educational point of view, diplomas in Professional audio design and producing, Further Education for Producers and Leads of the Finnish Game Industry with Adulta and Music Technology with high valued finnish institution, Sibelius Academy are the proof of talent in black and white.

The actual professional quantum leap for Ari was his five year long career as an in-house Audio Director with Frozenbyte, Inc. working as composer, sound designer and even a writer & designer with the games like Jack Claw Demo (Multiplatform) and Shadowgrounds Survivor (PC/2007) and outsourced to make the highly popular Super Stardust HD (PS3/2007). Now after 8 years of professional work in game industry, Ari has been making games likeTrine (PS3/PC), Angry Birds franchise (multiplatform), Dead Nation (PS3), Outland (PS3/360) and Bike Baron. Ari’s recently published games are Trine 2, Super Stardust Delta, Trine 2 The Goblin Menace and Angry Birds Trilogy and the latest one Resogun for PS4. These games have received rave reviews and praise for their soundtracks and sound design. Ari is currently working with various games and other really interesting projects.",1,0

Dennis was born in 1986 and when he was about 6 years old he started playing on the keyboard from his dad. He loved music and had the skills for it. He had keyboard lessons for about 5 years and played at school on special events. The funniest thing about him was, that he couldn't read notes, but when he heard some melody he played it right out of his head. Through the years he listened a lot to synthesizer music and especially Jean Michael Jarre. At the age of 12 Dennis came into the trance music and listened a lot to trance music like Armin van Buuren, Above & Beyond etc. In 2003 he started producing his own music, first with EJay, but that was too simple. Dennis wanted to create his own tunes so he got Propellorheads Reason. He started playing with it without having any knowledge about it. He all learned the program functions by hisself which took a lot of time. The genres that he produces are mostely trance/dance/electro. In 2005 he bought hisself a MIDI-keyboard which gave him lots of opportunities to create his own tunes right out of his mind. At that time he published his music online to let others listen to it and for receiving reviews to improve his tracks. Several times he ended in the top 10 from different charts on artist pages. Now after some years he started playing with FL again and want to create some new refreshing tunes.",1,0

2780,Gazus Snake,,fr,,,,"""I started tracking in 2002 with Modplug Tracker. Today, I use OpenMPT. As you can see, there's a great changing in my way of making music. My relation with music began when I was about 4 or 5, when my mother put a vinyle of Vivaldi on the turntable. After this moment, I wanted to learn to play the violin. That's what I did. I started this instrument at the age of 6. At 15, I took a old guitar which was around there and tried to get something from it. Two years later, I had my first electric guitar. Today I can say that I play the violin, the guitar, the bass, the chick, whatever with strings which needs to be played with fingers. I listen to various genres of music, from classical to electronica, from metal to experimental, from ambient to grindcore... I won't flood this page with a list of bands, including bands from which I only know one or two tracks or only the name. I like to compose whatever comes to my mind, including tracne, dnb, rock, classical, reggae, dub... I especially love to make chiptune, (kind of) breakcore and metal tracks. I also like to experimentalize with such methods to make music (use of crushed or randomly degraded samples, turned off speakers while writting the notes). It results with pieces that I could personnaly call ""Music"", even if it's sometimes hard to say. Experimentations kickxxx0r teh a5550R of teh Roxxx0r. "" - source s3m.com",1,0

2785,Gdream,,fr,,Arnaud,,"GDream discovered the soundtracking  in 1992 on Amiga and Atari, the used software were called (and are called always) SOUNDTRACKERS (software permitting to collect some sounds on channels audios), to this time we named them Soundtracker, Protracker, ScreamTracker, Noisetracker, OctaMED,. they used 4 or even 8 simultaneous channels on which it was necessary to play, bass, beats, melody, strings. These software were essentially used for the demos, music discs, demoscene as well as for the music of the games

In 1996, GDream discovers a software on pc that is going to revolutionize the world of the soundtracking, FASTTRACKER. It will replace all soundtrackers 4/8 channels by its 32 simultaneous channels. The used samples was of much better quality that the soundtrackers 4 channels. After we can find other software(Impulse Tracker, Madtracker, Skale Tracker, Renoise) same software than Fasttracker.

3446,Raffaele Cecco,London,gb,,,,"Raffaele Cecco is a British video games developer who has created numerous video games since 1984, including Cybernoid and Exolon. He grew up in Tottenham in North London.

Due to the popularity of Cecco's video games he was asked to write a monthly diary for CRASH magazine, the first installment being 15 April 1988.[1] The diary documented the development of Stormlord.

He first started programming on a ZX81 and his first release was Cop-Out, published by Mikro-Gen in 1986.

These are games that Cecco has developed or been closely associated with.

• Equinox (1986, Mikro-Gen)
• Exolon (1987, Hewson Consultants)
• Cybernoid (1988, Hewson Consultants)
• Stormlord (1989, Hewson Consultants)
• First Samurai (1991, Vivid Image)

A compilation of his games, Cecco's Collection, was released by Hewson in 1990, and includes Exolon, Cybernoid, Cybernoid II, and Stormlord. Your Sinclair awarded this compilation 92%, describing it as a fine three-year collection of Cecco's achievements and a succinct history of Spectrum programming to that date. The reviewer, Andy Ide, also considered Cecco as one of the Spectrum's biggest stars.",1,0

Since basic functionalities were programmed and self-awareness was achieved, it started learning by creating music in varying genres in mid nineties using tracker software and a computer. After hearing productions from hard techno labels, it started to upgrade its circuits and began reprogramming itself. As soon as it escaped from its manufacturers, it started DJing hard pounding techno with aggressive mixing style in national events and was already producing tracks with a more serious attitude. Its first release was a participation to Chris Liebing's (CLR) remix competition in 2004, from which it got its track selected in top 4 of 400 entries. Its sound can be recognized from dark atmospheric backgrounds with strong, more or less distorted beats.",1,0

3837,AmiGamer,,de,,Peer Bonzelius,,"Okay, I admit I didn't have a C64... I had a more or less exotic machine called ""Schneider"" in my home country (although on an international level, it's better known as ""Amstrad"").
Most of the C-64 games were converted to Amstrad, though - with the same (sometimes even a higher) sound quality.
My grandpa was a more or less famous piano player in Frankfurt (my home city in Germany) and left us an old piano on which I tried to play my favourite Amstrad games soundtracks. I never took any lessons, btw, I taught it to myself... frankly speaking, I can't even read or write notes or scores, but hey - neither could Chris Hülsbeck when he started to get into the business, and look where he is now! ;)
Anyway, after a couple years, I got my Amiga which really set a new benchmark regarding sound quality. By this time, I had already turned from piano to keyboards, workstations, synthesizers etc - basically everything that deals with synthetic music.
Even today, in the PC era, I'm still a huge fan of Amiga and Amstrad games, and with my equipment now allowing me to do much better cover versions of the soundtrack of my favouite games, I thought it would be a good idea to sign up here at Amigaremix and remix64 to share the results of my passion with the rest of the world.
So, if you love music the way I do or if you spent days (and nights) in front of your C64/Amiga/Amstrad/whatever like I did... then consider yourself member of the group of people i create my remixes for!",1,0

3851,glxblt,Varkaus,fi,,Ville Rastas,,"Being brought up in a family deeply involved with music, Ville Rastas
a.k.a ""Glxblt"" spent most of his childhood happily bashing both the keys
of his piano and his computer. However, as the young musician/geek
reached his puberty, things went horribly wrong. Despite the classical
training and responsible parenting, Glxblt developed an interest for
electronic music which later on evolved into full-blown love for techno
and especially drum'n'bass. Finding like-minded people in a small Finnish
city was practically impossible, but eventually it happened and Glxblt
made the first contact within the neighbouring town's rave scene and
coincidentally, the demoscene.

Since then the young junglist has honed his skills in producing and DJ'ing,
focusing on the darkest, techiest newschool drum'n'bass you can find without
forgetting about the rolling, danceable beats that define the genre.
Filling in the demand for harder, heavier drum'n'bass, Glxblt is a bundle
of big things just waiting to happen.",1,0
3852,elblanco,,us,,Mark Sanders,,"Sanders' history with music goes back to when he was 4 and saw Itzhak Perlman playing the violin. From that point on, he knew he was destined to become a violinist. At 6, his parents enrolled him in a piano school where he was selected to continue on with private lessons. At 9 he joined the local children's orchestra at his school finally getting his dream of playing the violin.

His time with the violin was a long, eventful and ultimately tragic one. While learning and developing his skills as a concert violinist, Sanders became concertmaster of three orchestras (his third and fourth year full symphonics and a selected chamber) and section leader of a fourth (Second violin, Prince William Youth Orchestra). These tenures were dramatic and culminated in 1995 with a tour of the Ural Mountain area in central Russia with a special chamber group and Quebec Province, Canada with a full symphonic. The Canadian tour ended with his orchestra winning a North American international symphonic orchestra competition where his group was the only U.S. based orchestra against a field of Canadian symphonies. He also participated in numerous trios, quartets and quintets and was guest concertmaster with a NYC based youth orchestra.

Despite these successes, his final two years of schooling were met with a great deal of pain. Finally, after 1995 Sanders could no longer play the violin and suffers from chronic neck pain and a mild arthritis to this day.

Fortunately, in his time with the symphonies, another musical interest had grabbed his attention, tracking. Sanders first started on the music scene composing music using an early version of ModEdit around 1992. After meeting with Ryan Cramer of the legendary U.S. demo group Renaissance, he was given an early version of Composer 669 and wrote several trial using this tracker. Later he graduated to the MultiTracker tracker written by Dan ""StarScream"" Goldstein of Renaissance. For a time, he worked closely with Phil Torelle (Darkwolf) during the period when Gravis Ultra Sound GUS tracking was common. After a short time learning the various aspects of multi-channel tracking, Sanders obtained an early copy of Scream Tracker III from members of Future Crew. It was during this time that he joined Kiwidog and Primal Scream and helped to form the initial trio of the infamous U.S. demo group Terraformer.

While a member of Terraformer, Sanders was his most prolific and produced hundreds of songs for demos (Hotel - Naid '96), intros (various), music disks (4 winds, various), games (an unpublished RPG and an unpublished racing game called Forge optioned by Bethesda Softworks) and solo releases. He grew a cult following over the years and influenced, coached (and was influenced and coached) other well known trackers such as Awesome (who later went on to make the Fast Tracker derivative Skale Tracker), LB, Vit-B, Stein, Coplan (StaticLine) and others. He also participated in numerous compos, placing consistently in the top 20. He won the Naid 96' 3channel chip tune compo with a novel 2-channel chiptune Dual Complex and placed well in the multi-channel compo. He won the '96 U.S. East-Coast Compo Retro (consisting of only U.S. based East Coast demo groups) 1-hour compo with Master of Madness and several other constrained rules compos (GC, chip, etc). ",1,0

Ok here goes... I go by the nick Waxhead and my real name is Svein (sounds like swine in english... quite appropriate I have to admit).
My first computer was a C64 and after some time I moved to Amiga who was exposed to numerous hacks and upgrades. It was not until 2k I made the swap to a heater (read:std pc). For the Amiga I started with Amos, moved to AmigaE and some 68K assembly at the end. I coded a few minor tools but the only notable thing I did was write a ProTracker clone called AdeptTracker who used the AmigaOS2.0 system GUI instead of the more common custom GUI's around. (can be found by googling ""AdeptTracker Aminet"") for those of you who are interested.
We also made a few ""demos"" released at TG97 (13th and 15th place).
My skills are coding, music, 3dgfx, 2dgfx and just about a little bit of everything you can think of.
As for the more recent years the more notable stuff I have done is a utility called DriveGLEAM who is a software based hard disk indicator LED thing + CPU & MEM usage etc...
Other projects I am involed in are the www.6581-8580.com (SOASC=) and www.paula8364.com (SOAMC=) projects. I manage the server + write the code that runs the database. Due to various reasons our server is on very limited bandwidth at the moment (hint hint).

Ok that's it... I'm done advertising now ",1,0

He has been playing on many instruments since his childhood; in his compositions he strives to integrate these in unusual ways.  

One of Nebidaan's specialties is composing layered, dark, ambient-like music for films and video games. When composing, he always pays attention to the complementary role of music, and tries to use it accordingly - to deepen the atmosphere. 

Beside composing, he also plays in a metal band as rhythm/lead guitarist, and recently he started his own project as well. "" - Taken from his website",1,0

4475,M.A.F,,Scotland,,Michael Ferguson,,"Became fascinated with computer music in 1985 starting on the Spectrum 48k,I was stunned by the music of Tim Foliin and others such as Richard Joseph,who managed to make the single channel Spectrum sound like it had multiple sound channels!  Amazing!

Next big thing for me was the Spectrum 128 with 3 REAL sound channels of sound to play with!  I was aware of the C64 at that time but I didn't want to admit to a friend that his Commodore 64 sounded much better than the Spectrum! I eventually heard more of the C64 soundtracks at my friends house and I was converted!

I loved the sounds of the '64 and even more so,certain composers soundtracks for the games. They sounded amazing to me!

I am not a musician of any kind,but from 1990 onwards,I wanted to get myself some music equipment,so I did. Teaching myself along the way without actually mastering anything,I started programming my own tunes using an Amiga connected to synthesizers and synthesizer modules via MIDI.

Created one remix of an Amiga game soundtrack in 1999 and it was submitted to AmigaRemix in 2003,also tried a remix of Last Ninja 2 Central Park Theme from the '64.

As usual for me I didn't finish it,and the effort I made now exists as an mp3 of the crap tape I recorded my demo on, complete with tape hiss galore!

I continued to create music of my own as and when I could be bothered until I  eventually gave it up. .I sold all of my equipment on Ebay in 2004.(but keeping my 1200's as well as the MIDI interface just in case I changed my mind)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New info for anyone interested.

I now have many of my own original recordings using the Amiga and analogue synthesizers available for download at the below link.

 

https://archive.org/search.php?query=M.A.F%20AND%20collection%3Aopensource_audio

 

Please take a look and have a listen.

 

Many original Amiga modules I created are available there,as well as Amiga,C64 and Spectrum 128 game music remixes I arranged as well.All sequenced on the Amiga.

4651,Altus,,ca,,Mike Carss,,"Carss began making music in the form of 4-channel MODs in 1993 using a program called ModEdit. He moved to Fasttracker, followed by Fasttracker 2 where he was finally able to stretch his musical wings.

During that time, he produced techno/IDM style music under the monkier Goon. His first release “Perpetual Wonder” (1996) was available on limited-release cassette. He also collaborated with Blair Vermette (a fellow artist he met in college) under the name Obtuse-idiom. They produced another limited cassette release “Ode to Bambi” (1997), followed by “Horizon” (1998) which was never properly released, however most of the tracks from that album are available in their native XM format on various archive sites on the net.

After that time, Carss grew tired of beats in general and began to experiment with more ambient styles of music. The result was “Moonlight” (2000), which was never properly released to the public at all. It was different, but he wasn’t terribly happy with the final result.

Then suddenly everything clicked, and Altus was born.

After writing “24 Hours” (2001), a concept album consisting of four 15-minute tracks, he had found his calling. Inspiration struck hard. Between 2001 to 2010, Altus has produced 25 albums ranging from light ambient/new age, dark ambient, symphonic and drone.",1,0

Visa Röster is a Swedish vocal ensemble singing computer music, hymns and jazz - a cappella. Three CDs and a DVD from our successful concert in London.

Visa Röster performs a cappella, voices only, no instruments. Music has never been more comfortable! Swinging arrangements and jazzy arrangements performed in a professional way. And it sounds so good!

The name ""Visa Röster"" is Swedish (our main audience is Swedish), and translated it would be ""Show Voices"", where ""visa"" actually means ""show"", ""tune"" and ""enlightened"" at the same time. It's pretty hard to translate it, so we decided not to! We're living in the South of Sweden, in the cities of Malmö and Lund.

4731,gwEm,London,gb,,Gareth Morris,,"With a career in 8bit music lasting more than 15 years and over two hundred gigs in at least twenty countries, few musicians in the 8bit scene can claim to be more seasoned than gwEm. His travels have taken him as far east as Japan, as far north as Norway, as far south as India, as far west as the United States and he has no plans of hanging up his trademark Flying V guitar anytime soon.

gwEm, known to his mother as Gareth Morris, creates his 8bit music using the maxYMiser software he wrote for the 1980s Atari ST homecomputer and talks excitedly about the artistic freedom the 8bit scene gives him. ""8bit music gives me the carte blanche to explore any genre I want, while still remaining under the umbrella of the friendly chip music scene"". Certainly his extensive back catalogue of material bears this out, with drum'n'bass, punk, heavy metal, garage, electro, folk, house, grime, dad rock, happy hardcore and dubstep all present and correct.

gwEm's releases can be found on a number of net and physical labels including Astralwerks, Cheapbeats Tokyo, 8bitpeoples, micromusic, Shitkatapult and Muller. Collaborations with fellow London based artists, grime MC Appljuic and (famously) jazz drummer/jungle MC Counter Reset have been more than fruitful.",1,0

Synth Sample
Georg Feil, ©1985 Georg Feil

    Tune comments:

COMMENT: All comments for this file are by Georg Feil himself and are denoted
         by (GF).
         ""I wrote it around '84 or '85 as a demo for my music editor called
         'Synth'. I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just
         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on
         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.
         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with
         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I
         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like
         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.
         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.
         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of
         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that
         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had
         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,
         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed
         (but then broke up [...]). So I guess you can credit that little
         program with launching my musical career..."" (GF)",1,0

He created his very own style which is at the same time virtuous and technically brilliant.

I started making computer music in 1995, thanks to the wonders of Scream Tracker 3 by the Future Crew. A few years later came the revolutionary Impulse Tracker and finally Propellerhead Reason, wich is my DAW of choice.

In 2011 I started using Arkos Tracker to compose chiptunes for the Amstrad CPC and since that happy accident I've made the music and sound fx for a few demos and games for the Amstrad CPC and the ZX Spectrum.

I do websites (like this one) for a living and I have a passion for the retro computer scene, the making of new productions for old computers and also for the demoscene, since I watched Second Reality on my first PC (A 486DX2 machine).",1,0

Started buying records seriously to play at small venues in a local town.
bought first set of Technics 1210s in 1992 playing detroit and european Techno.
My brother and I bought first keyboard around 1993. A Roland XP50 Workstation.
Then bought smaller modules and fx units to enhance our sound.
At that point Electronic/IDM and Ambient music seemed to be drawing me in.

Big influences were artists like Autechre, Speedy J, Boards Of Canada and other WARP artists. Eventually got my own house a few years later,and then decided to start picking up my own bits of kit to create my own studio.

Up to this present day I have been inspired by a lot of excellent producers and more recently by artists like Planet Boelex, Mosaik and Solar-fields.",1,0

I'm eXOdus, and I've been tracking for five years now.
I started out using FastTracker II on a Pentium II. Now I use Renoise 3.1, along with tons of different VSTs, and my only hardware synth, an Ensoniq TS-10 (a ROMpler).

I haven't been involved in the scene in a while, school, trying to find myself and the like, but I can't abandon the people who got me started writing music. My music took a hit as I learned how to mix and master music, but now I've finally learned how and I can happily return to writing stuff similar to the modules I tracked before.

Beyond music, I enjoy running distance, writing stories and poetry, and programming.

Hope you enjoy my music, new and old, modules and FLAC (and MP3 before I used FLAC). Most of my music from 2014 is bad though, so be forewarned.

After we met online and started making music together, the project xyce took off and about 7 years later we made five albums, did numerous liveshows throughout the world and continue to have a heck-load-of-fun.

I had contact with the C64 Scene since 1984 and I was in the demo group 'Future Technologics 2009' from 1987-1991 as swapper. In 1988 I did start to compose music, first in the Future Composer.
After this I used Voicetracker. I did teach myself composing learning by doing. I play not any music instrument, that I did not learn any music instrument can sometimes be a advantage but sometimes also a pain.

In 1991 I stopped with the C64 and I moved to the PC. I made quite alot tunes on the PC with the Scream Tracker, some Scream Tracker tunes was uploaded on some Mailboxes.

1998 I found my C64 in a hidden place and I made some tunes for my own pleasure in the Soundbooster from Midas. Between 1998 - 2003 I made some PC-Songs with a other music-edior.

Around 2003 I found in the net some Scene pages and finally in 2004 I rejoined the C64 Scene as Musician.
I was very happy that the JCH Editor was now free available and I must say that JCH was with his JCH Editor miles before its time(maybe Time-Machine).",1,0

Sigurd plays and creates mostly electronic music on his Mac, while Michael for the most part plays in metal bands. The idea was to take popular hits that can be played on the dance floor and add heavy guitars over it. The result of this being that the duo played on a night club in Arendal, Norway, where Sigurd played the role of the DJ and Michael came along with a big amplifier, long hair and his guitar into the night club scene. Everything from AC/DC to Lady Gaga was played.

The response was a mixture of people who thought this project was original and swell and people who thought it was just downright dumb. 

Self written compositions were later added to the reportoaire. Per September 2015 there are recorded 3 self written songs, where one of them was mixed by power metal legend Timo Tolkki. (Ex Stratovarius.)

He started to play the guitar when he was young, surrounded by the filthy sounds of Post-Hardcore, Grindcore and Noise Rock. His love for these genres feeds into his electronic music, as he tries to translate the raw power and energy of these styles into his own sound. His discovery of Venetian Snares and Xanopticon opened new boundaries for him to explore, and the result of these influences can be heard in his music; where crushing bass lines and aggression meet heavy complex beats and intricate melodies.
