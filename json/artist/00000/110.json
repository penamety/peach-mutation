  "info": "Ben Daglish (born 1966 in London, United Kingdom) is a composer and musician. Originally from London, his parents moved to the steel city of Sheffield when Ben was one. Daglish is known for creating many soundtracks during the 1980s for home computer games, including such Commodore 64 hits as The Last Ninja, Trap, and Deflektor. Daglish teamed up with fellow C64 musician and prolific programmer, Tony Crowther, forming W.E.M.U.S.I.C., which stood for \"We Make Use of Sound In Computers\".\n\nDaglish lives in Derbyshire where he still composes, plays and performs in a number of UK bands, including Loscoe State Opera. He also regularly performs with violinist madfiddler and the band SID80s at retro computer game events such as Back In Time Live and Retrovision. He has also performed with Commodore 64 revival band PRESS PLAY ON TAPE together with Rob Hubbard. He is a fan of the late Ronnie Hazlehurst, a prolific composer for TV.\n\n(excerpt from Wikipedia)",
