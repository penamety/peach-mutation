  "info": "\"Gunnar Gaubatz (Big Alec) is one of the classic composers on the Atari ST and raised the level of Chipsound on the YM a bit higher in the early nineties. He was very eager with producing accurate chip-drums which sounds nearly like sampled. This was before the scene opened up and new programming-techniques evolved. His works are still outstanding in comparison. With \"Prophecy\" he has managed to incorporate new techniques, he called it his crown-jewel, his magnus-opus.\"\n\nMicrozeit.",
