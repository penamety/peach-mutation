  "info": "When moving from trackers and the demoscene on to commercial music endeavours, Lassi Nikko (a.k.a. Dune) donned the stage name Brothomstates (initial capitalization brothomStates). In the beginning it also functioned as a band name for cooperations and live appearances encompassing fellow musicians such as Mikko Karvonen (a.k.a. Yolk, a.k.a. Crankshaft). The Brothomstates name was also used on the Finnish electronic jazz band RinneRadio's remix album \"B\" by Nikko's Orange group mate Veikka Erkola (a.k.a. Sulphur, a.k.a. Ercola), who has also acted as a producer for RinneRadio.",
