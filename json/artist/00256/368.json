Yeah, I know it sounds pretty lame but I guess I'm excused since I was only 11-12 years when I took it. My brother Ole (Pet) is still teasing me with it! I later changed my handle to Drax which isn't much better, but who cares? I have had that handle since 1988-89 and it was Tiger of Noise who suggested it, I guess I just thought: \"Yeah, hmmm... why not?\"\n\nTrivia :\nThomas started making music on the C64 in 1988. He joined Vibrants in 1989 as the third member, and immediately started using JCH music-editor V2.53. He composed almost 1000 tunes on the C64 alone, but he has also composed music for other computer formats. In 1996, he joined Maniacs of Noise.\n\n\"My brother Ole, being a total computer geek, have definitely influenced me - yeah, that's right, I blame it on you, thank you very much! ;) I remember him programming demos, making graphics, composing music and also some swapping. The music-making especially caught my attention and I started trying out Soundmonitor V1.0 and Rob Hubbard's player in a monitor. I still wonder where my tunes in Hubbard's driver are. My brother was a member of a local group together with Tiger and he played some of my music and Tiger was pleasantly surprised and told me that Bones was looking for a musician. I then sent some music to Max/Bones, he liked it and asked me to join - and I did. Later I joined Noise and after that several other groups.\"\n\n\"My proudest moment was when I joined Maniacs of Noise. Jeroen Tel contacted me in 1996 and asked if I was interested in being a MoN member. Since MoN was my absolute favourite group, I didn't hesitate for a moment and joined.\"\n\n[url]http://noname.c64.org/csdb/scener/?id=16[/url]",
