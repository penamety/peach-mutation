  "info": "hunz does all kind of music types. When I heard \"clone it\" from hornet.org in the 90's it was a total tracker shock for me. I knew I must hear everything from him and he soon became a favorite of mine. The more I downloaded and heard the more I was surprised about his kind of arrangements, melodies and expression in his electro music. I hope you all enjoy the songs like I do. They're not all easy to listen. Some of them are really deeply sad/melancholic/moody. Often they need to be listened more than 1 time. If you let yourself drown in them, you never will have missed one of his songs. \nseppjo ",
