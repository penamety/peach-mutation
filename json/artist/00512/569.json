  "info": "\"My real name is Jan C. Obergfell, which should explain my pseudonym \"jco\". I was born in 1982, and became fascinated by technology early enough to witness the breathtaking, ongoing revolution that began when homecomputers became affordable. The first machine I laid my hands on was a C116, and then a C64 on which I wrote my first BASIC-Programs (but my interesting BASIC-Programs I wrote on an Atari 1040 STE).\n\n(...)\n\nI came into contact with \"modern music production\" as soon as there were sufficiently powerful computers around. While I had my first tries with computer-aided music-production with my Atari and a MIDI-Capable electric piano, things became really interesting when I had my first AWE32...\n\n(...)\n\nSimply put, I'm totally stunned by the creative possibilities that come with my current equipment.\n\nYou might have noticed that I did not actually tell anything personal about myself, nothing which explains why I do what I do. As to that, I could write much for sure, but I would never regard it as true. I believe the answer to why I do what I do lies somewhere within what I do. But of course, you may always ask me about my intentions :)\"\n\n- info taken from: [url=http://www.jco-music.de/jco_en.html]http://www.jco-music.de/jco_en.html[/url]",
