  "info": "In the memories of a Maestro\n\nFriday the 14th of June 1996, an old amiga musician, Martin \"Maestro\" Agger had an heart attack and died in Aarhus, Denmark, 24 years old.\n\nMartin was welknown back in 1988-1992 for the great modules he composed for demos and games. He produced his best pieces for groups like Kefrens, Flash Production and Anarchy.\n\nToday Martin will be remembered for the great mind he had, and the openminded approach he had towards everything. Martin was the kind of friend, who always helped you up when you were down, and celebrated with you, when back on the top. And thats why, he will be so awfully missed by his friends, his girlfriend and the family.\n\nThe last couple of years, Martin started working alot with 3D modelling, and he had a great talent for that too. Just 2 months before his tragic death, he started as a computer modeller at the Danish national television, DR, which ofcourse made both him and us very proud.\n\nAs an end, I can only say how sorry I am, that you are not among us anymore, Martin.\n\nFrom your friend, who will miss you forever ...\n\nTony \"Gonzo\" Fonager",
