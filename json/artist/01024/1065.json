  "info": "[i]From last.fm:[/i]\nEric Gieseke, also known as Sidewinder and DJ Spankinspock, is a musician from Boston, USA. He started on his musical journey in the 80s by entering the tracker scene, producing modules using ProTracker for the Amiga. He had several releases through groups like Megawatts, Porphyria and InfoCorner, until he withdrew from the scene in the mid 90s. Going from techno, rave and latin-inspired breaks, to house and even a few jazzy tunes, his music comprehends a vast variety of styles and is defined as playful and melodic with a true spirit.\n\nIn March 1994 he released his debut album, Future Shock 2, a 100% Amiga recorded album produced in a professional studio during the last quarter of 1993. It also features a bonus track from the popular Amiga game, Scorched Tanks, remixed in CD quality.\n\nAfter leaving the Amiga scene and going back underground, Sidewinder made a pop-up entrance by the millennium shift with the release of a second album in 1999, 2badsheep. This release featured 19 of his later recordings, making a blend of tracked modules and newly recorded tracks. And as one would expect of Sidewinder, all in a twisted variety of styles with jamming melodies.\n\nSome of his unreleased tracks from the late 90â€™s can be downloaded for free at his official website, www.2badsheep.com.",
