  "info": "aka Funkymuskrat\n\nGreetings! I’m Ariel. I have a wife and two kids, and they are the loves of my life and my best friends. I like to compose music and experiment with sound. I like to draw, whether it’s pen and paper or pixel art, it doesn’t really matter. I like playing games and I like making games. I like reading and writing. I like listening to music with my eyes closed. I like closing my eyes in general. I like… you? Contact me.\n\nI learned how to compose music using trackers in the early 90’s by hanging out in the demoscene. In 1996, my involvement with an ANSI art group, ACiD, landed me my first video game music composition and sound design gig with Webfoot Games. I worked for Webfoot for many years. I worked on lots of casual PC games and a Dragon Ball Z title for the Game Boy Advance. Loved every minute.\n\nI’m currently Audio Director at QC Games. Before that, I was a producer at BioWare. Before that, I was at Volition in the role of Studio Audio Director. Building a career in game development has been a challenge for the ages, but it has been worth it. It has consistently surrounded me with brilliant and talented people, and I’d like that to continue. So maybe you should get in touch?",
