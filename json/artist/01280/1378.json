  "info": "I'm from Norway and have been composing music for over 15 years, starting with OctaMED on the Amiga, moving through Scream Tracker and Impulse Tracker on the PC, then migrating to Reason, and finally Pro Tools which I still use today. I have also just started using the full version of Renoise. I don't limit myself to any particular style, but I'm fond of composing soundtrack-oriented music.\n\nI used to be part of the Reviewers Overseeing Committee at the old Trax in Space website, and I have great plans for my presence here at the new one. I'm very excited to see that TiS has returned.",
