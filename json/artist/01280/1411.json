Too bad that i haven´t organized & archived my work earlier -.- Most of the gfx and sounds got lost during moving. Only some cassettes with music from the Amiga times are left.\n\nSince i was using the PC for audio production, (nearly) all MP3s got stored...only some project-files got lost during a HDD-crash:-( So if i want to change something, i have to re-create these traxx.\n\nSee ya / hear ya ^^\n\nIc3m4n\n\n(aka BASSit)\"",
