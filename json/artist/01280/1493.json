  "info": "Thomas Bucsics a.k.a. nexxyz is an Austrian composer/producer/performer of electronic music currently living in Vienna. \n\nHe has a strong passion of Nintendo products, and especially for using them in ways they were not originally intended for. Nothing naughty, though, just writing and using homebrew, and using them to write and perform even more electronic music.\n\nAfter living in both Ecuador and Norway for a while (not at once, though), he works influences of lots of artists from those places, as well as influences from the Austrian scenes into his music.\n\nThe style of nexxyzâ€™ music ranges from Chiptune-y over Technoid to Breakbeaty and Orchestral. While he usually writes original tunes, he once in a while also enjoys giving a tune written by someone else a new face by producing his own cover.\n\nIn his more or less real life he works in the field of computer science and testing. His hobbies include, but are not limited to:\n Writing music, games, watching movies, martial arts, cooking, reading, smart-assing, crashing radio controlled vehicles and being with his girlfriend.\n",
