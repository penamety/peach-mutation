  "info": "I started working with FM trackers in 2002 (music from this era is safe to ignore). I'm making sample-based tracker music in ModPlug and OpenMPT since 2004 in no fixed style (though I tend to do a lot of synthpop and trance-ish stuff these days). I'm a crew member of [url=https://modarchive.org]The Mod Archive[/url], a moderator at Nectarine (No link needed, duh) and also deeply involved with [url=https://openmpt.org/]OpenMPT[/url].\n\nHave a look at my [url=ftp://ftp.untergrund.net/users/sagamusix/music/]untergrund ftp account[/url] if you want to download all my stuff in one go. :)",
