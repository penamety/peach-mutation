  "info": "Hello, I am Jukka Koops and I design things.\n\nI work as a senior designer at Nordkapp and co-lead Colorshki. I'm experienced in designing engaging ways for people to use products and services on and off screen. My work is evolving between the fields of graphic design and branding, service and product design, concept and interaction design, sound design and motion graphics.\n\nOccasionally I make music as Curve Quartet. You can listen to it on Soundcloud and download it for free.\n\nI'm one of the people behind Pingstate and have spent some of my nerdy past in the demo scene as part of Moppi Productions.",
