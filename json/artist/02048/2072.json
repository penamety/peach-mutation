  "info": "Hello there! I am a dedicated tracker-musician who started tracking with the most ultimate Fasttracker ][ at around 96. That, as you probably can calculateis now a very long time ago.\n\nAt 2003, FT2 gave up on me! I couldn't find any new sound cards that worked with it. So I browsed the net and found several trackers, including Fasttracker ]|[, later Sk@le, Madttracker 2 and even Modplug! But either they where incomplete, buggy or simply did not fit my taste, especially Madtracker ][ and ModPlug because of the dreaded Windows GIU! *shivers*\n\nLater on I stumbled upon Renoise!! And man, was I ever taken by surprise! So BEAUTIFUL, so easy to use! No crappy windows GUI, just that wonderful old DOS-feeling! The DSPs, multiple tracks on one channel etc etc... Ahhh... Never looked back!\n\nI am a now a proud member and co-founder of Chimera Music, including the founder Alpha Centauri along with musician and \"graphician\" Okeanos, and the musicians and also multitalented JvK, Rayko and John Marwin.",
