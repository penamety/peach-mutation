  "info": "Syphus started playing piano, violin and Commodore Amiga in 1989, at the age of 6. After growing up with the demoscene, trackers and chipmusic (and growing bored of playing bass in angry teenage metal bands), he finally started to release his tracked music in chipdisks and demos with the likes of CoolPhat, BDSE, Swedish megastars Up Rough and the mysterious Eunoia.\n\nSuddenly, the 21st Century arrives and the kids are down with the chippy bleeps! What to do?!? Saddle up that Amiga and take it to the streets! Syphus plays regular live sets in his hometown of Newcastle - the chip music capital of the UK - and has toured twice with Sabrepulse and the Chiptune Alliance. Recent activities include lecturing on chipmusic-related subjects at Newcastle University, co-founding the eclectic label Stropic Recordings and being a drunken fixture at various European demoparties.",
