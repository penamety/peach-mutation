He loved music and had the skills for it. He had keyboard lessons for about 5 years and played at school on special events. The funniest thing about him was, that he couldn't read notes, but when he heard some melody he played it right out of his head. Through the years he listened a lot to synthesizer music and especially Jean Michael Jarre. At the age of 12 Dennis came into the trance music and listened a lot to trance music like Armin van Buuren, Above & Beyond etc. In 2003 he started producing his own music, first with EJay, but that was too simple. Dennis wanted to create his own tunes so he got Propellorheads Reason. He started playing with it without having any knowledge about it. He all learned the program functions by hisself which took a lot of time. The genres that he produces are mostely trance/dance/electro. In 2005 he bought hisself a MIDI-keyboard which gave him lots of opportunities to create his own tunes right out of his mind. At that time he published his music online to let others listen to it and for receiving reviews to improve his tracks. Several times he ended in the top 10 from different charts on artist pages. Now after some years he started playing with FL again and want to create some new refreshing tunes.",
