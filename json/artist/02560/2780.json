  "info": "\"I started tracking in 2002 with Modplug Tracker. Today, I use OpenMPT. As you can see, there's a great changing in my way of making music. My relation with music began when I was about 4 or 5, when my mother put a vinyle of Vivaldi on the turntable. After this moment, I wanted to learn to play the violin. That's what I did. I started this instrument at the age of 6. At 15, I took a old guitar which was around there and tried to get something from it. Two years later, I had my first electric guitar. Today I can say that I play the violin, the guitar, the bass, the chick, whatever with strings which needs to be played with fingers. I listen to various genres of music, from classical to electronica, from metal to experimental, from ambient to grindcore... I won't flood this page with a list of bands, including bands from which I only know one or two tracks or only the name. I like to compose whatever comes to my mind, including tracne, dnb, rock, classical, reggae, dub... I especially love to make chiptune, (kind of) breakcore and metal tracks. I also like to experimentalize with such methods to make music (use of crushed or randomly degraded samples, turned off speakers while writting the notes). It results with pieces that I could personnaly call \"Music\", even if it's sometimes hard to say. Experimentations kickxxx0r teh a5550R of teh Roxxx0r. \" - source s3m.com",
