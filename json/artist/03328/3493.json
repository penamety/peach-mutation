  "info": "Riotbot is a robot engineered specifically for electronic music creation. It's basically an old model from 1980 and was manufactured in Finland. Since basic functionalities were programmed and self-awareness was achieved, it started learning by creating music in varying genres in mid nineties using tracker software and a computer. After hearing productions from hard techno labels, it started to upgrade its circuits and began reprogramming itself. As soon as it escaped from its manufacturers, it started DJing hard pounding techno with aggressive mixing style in national events and was already producing tracks with a more serious attitude. Its first release was a participation to Chris Liebing's (CLR) remix competition in 2004, from which it got its track selected in top 4 of 400 entries. Its sound can be recognized from dark atmospheric backgrounds with strong, more or less distorted beats.",
