  "info": "Being brought up in a family deeply involved with music, Ville Rastas\na.k.a \"Glxblt\" spent most of his childhood happily bashing both the keys\nof his piano and his computer. However, as the young musician/geek\nreached his puberty, things went horribly wrong. Despite the classical\ntraining and responsible parenting, Glxblt developed an interest for\nelectronic music which later on evolved into full-blown love for techno\nand especially drum'n'bass. Finding like-minded people in a small Finnish\ncity was practically impossible, but eventually it happened and Glxblt\nmade the first contact within the neighbouring town's rave scene and\ncoincidentally, the demoscene.\n\nSince then the young junglist has honed his skills in producing and DJ'ing,\nfocusing on the darkest, techiest newschool drum'n'bass you can find without\nforgetting about the rolling, danceable beats that define the genre.\nFilling in the demand for harder, heavier drum'n'bass, Glxblt is a bundle\nof big things just waiting to happen.",
