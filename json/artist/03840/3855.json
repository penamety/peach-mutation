  "info": "Me like muzak. Old muzak. New muzak. Blue. Red. All colors and flavours!\n\nLately I've discovered the joy of isolating myself in the basement for weeks in a row, re-producing old c64 and Amiga tracks. When I am alone in my realm I need nothing from the outside world. Only beer. And snus. Ah, yes and my cat. I am lucky to have a very understanding wife who puts up with my neverending studio-sessions!\n\nWhen I stumbled across remix64.com and RKO it brought such great memories from the glorious days. And well-produced memories, too! I could not believe that the scene was still so active and that people spent time recreating the tunes that we all used to love so much.",
