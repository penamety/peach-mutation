  "info": "\"Nebidaan (Bence Tasnadi) is a classically trained hungarian composer, who has been writing music for almost a decade in different genres, from electronic to orchestral. He has been playing on many instruments since his childhood; in his compositions he strives to integrate these in unusual ways.  \n\nOne of Nebidaan's specialties is composing layered, dark, ambient-like music for films and video games. When composing, he always pays attention to the complementary role of music, and tries to use it accordingly - to deepen the atmosphere. \n\nBeside composing, he also plays in a metal band as rhythm/lead guitarist, and recently he started his own project as well. \" - Taken from his website",
