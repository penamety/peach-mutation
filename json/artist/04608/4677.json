  "info": "From their website:\n\nVisa Röster is a Swedish vocal ensemble singing computer music, hymns and jazz - a cappella. Three CDs and a DVD from our successful concert in London.\n\nVisa Röster performs a cappella, voices only, no instruments. Music has never been more comfortable! Swinging arrangements and jazzy arrangements performed in a professional way. And it sounds so good!\n\nThe name \"Visa Röster\" is Swedish (our main audience is Swedish), and translated it would be \"Show Voices\", where \"visa\" actually means \"show\", \"tune\" and \"enlightened\" at the same time. It's pretty hard to translate it, so we decided not to! We're living in the South of Sweden, in the cities of Malmö and Lund.\n\nMembers:\n\nSofia Åberg\nKarin Öjehagen\nHanna Kappelin\nElsa Persson\nPex Tufvesson\nJohannes Lindén",
