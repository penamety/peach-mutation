I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just\n         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on\n         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.\n         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with\n         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I\n         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like\n         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.\n         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.\n         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of\n         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that\n         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had\n         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,\n         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed\n         (but then broke up [...]). So I guess you can credit that little\n         program with launching my musical career...\" (GF)",
