  "info": "Born and raised in Málaga (home of the Costa del Sol), in Spain. I'm a kid of the 80's, and I grow up listening to all the 80's electronic music that played on the radio and tv and to the tunes that my Amstrad CPC played through it's little speaker.\n\nI started making computer music in 1995, thanks to the wonders of Scream Tracker 3 by the Future Crew. A few years later came the revolutionary Impulse Tracker and finally Propellerhead Reason, wich is my DAW of choice.\n\nIn 2011 I started using Arkos Tracker to compose chiptunes for the Amstrad CPC and since that happy accident I've made the music and sound fx for a few demos and games for the Amstrad CPC and the ZX Spectrum.\n\nI do websites (like this one) for a living and I have a passion for the retro computer scene, the making of new productions for old computers and also for the demoscene, since I watched Second Reality on my first PC (A 486DX2 machine).",
