  "info": "Patashu started composing in March 2012 on Famitracker and still uses it to this date. Most of his work is 2A03/VRC6.\n\nPrior to then his time was spent playing Stepmania and crafting hundreds and hundreds of charts (4k keyboard spread, solo (6k keyboard spread) and a little pad) for the game.\nDoing this built up a kind of latent musical analytical ability and desire to see new, complex music come to life that was finally released by Famitracker!",
