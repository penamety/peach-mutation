  "info": "Bitbear is Asbjørn Ulsberg's tone-hammering, beat-juggling and demoscene participating alter ego.\n\nBitbear started fiddling with music in Pro Tracker on the Amiga 500 in the early 90's. But first when he got his hands on Scream Tracker and Fast Tracker on a PC, he started producing \"real\" music under the alias \"Power of Creation\". He created two albums and submitted songs to various demoscene competitions throughout the 90's until he put his musical career on the shelf until it was rebooted in 2012 by entering the Kindergarden 2012 Dance Music Competition under the new-found alias Bitbear.\n",
