  "info": "Got into Electronic music from an early age, around the mid to late 80s.\nStarted buying records seriously to play at small venues in a local town.\nbought first set of Technics 1210s in 1992 playing detroit and european Techno.\nMy brother and I bought first keyboard around 1993. A Roland XP50 Workstation.\nThen bought smaller modules and fx units to enhance our sound.\nAt that point Electronic/IDM and Ambient music seemed to be drawing me in.\n\nBig influences were artists like Autechre, Speedy J, Boards Of Canada and other WARP artists. Eventually got my own house a few years later,and then decided to start picking up my own bits of kit to create my own studio.\n\nUp to this present day I have been inspired by a lot of excellent producers and more recently by artists like Planet Boelex, Mosaik and Solar-fields.",
