  "info": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm eXOdus, and I've been tracking for five years now.\nI started out using FastTracker II on a Pentium II. Now I use Renoise 3.1, along with tons of different VSTs, and my only hardware synth, an Ensoniq TS-10 (a ROMpler).\n\nI haven't been involved in the scene in a while, school, trying to find myself and the like, but I can't abandon the people who got me started writing music. My music took a hit as I learned how to mix and master music, but now I've finally learned how and I can happily return to writing stuff similar to the modules I tracked before.\n\nBeyond music, I enjoy running distance, writing stories and poetry, and programming.\n\nHope you enjoy my music, new and old, modules and FLAC (and MP3 before I used FLAC). Most of my music from 2014 is bad though, so be forewarned.\n\n-eXOdus",
