  "info": "\nI had contact with the C64 Scene since 1984 and I was in the demo group 'Future Technologics 2009' from 1987-1991 as swapper. In 1988 I did start to compose music, first in the Future Composer.\nAfter this I used Voicetracker. I did teach myself composing learning by doing. I play not any music instrument, that I did not learn any music instrument can sometimes be a advantage but sometimes also a pain.\n\nIn 1991 I stopped with the C64 and I moved to the PC. I made quite alot tunes on the PC with the Scream Tracker, some Scream Tracker tunes was uploaded on some Mailboxes.\n\n1998 I found my C64 in a hidden place and I made some tunes for my own pleasure in the Soundbooster from Midas. Between 1998 - 2003 I made some PC-Songs with a other music-edior.\n\nAround 2003 I found in the net some Scene pages and finally in 2004 I rejoined the C64 Scene as Musician.\nI was very happy that the JCH Editor was now free available and I must say that JCH was with his JCH Editor miles before its time(maybe Time-Machine).",
