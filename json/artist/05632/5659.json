  "info": "Michael Keihl and Sigurd Borg√•s are two 30 year old musicians that decided to attempt an unusual music project. \n\nSigurd plays and creates mostly electronic music on his Mac, while Michael for the most part plays in metal bands. The idea was to take popular hits that can be played on the dance floor and add heavy guitars over it. The result of this being that the duo played on a night club in Arendal, Norway, where Sigurd played the role of the DJ and Michael came along with a big amplifier, long hair and his guitar into the night club scene. Everything from AC/DC to Lady Gaga was played.\n\nThe response was a mixture of people who thought this project was original and swell and people who thought it was just downright dumb. \n\nSelf written compositions were later added to the reportoaire. Per September 2015 there are recorded 3 self written songs, where one of them was mixed by power metal legend Timo Tolkki. (Ex Stratovarius.)\n\nHolly JR. Have their base in Arendal, Norway.",
