  "info": "2methyl (aka 2methylBulbe1ol) is a part of the dubstep/idm french underground wave since 2008. He started to play the guitar when he was young, surrounded by the filthy sounds of Post-Hardcore, Grindcore and Noise Rock. His love for these genres feeds into his electronic music, as he tries to translate the raw power and energy of these styles into his own sound. His discovery of Venetian Snares and Xanopticon opened new boundaries for him to explore, and the result of these influences can be heard in his music; where crushing bass lines and aggression meet heavy complex beats and intricate melodies.\n\n(Source: Youtube profile)",
