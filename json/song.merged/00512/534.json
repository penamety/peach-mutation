  "info": "Barry Leitch: I had the initial chord progression idea and had the yello samples, the melody just wrote itself around the chords, add in the chip lead guitar type solo at.the end.cos.I had no memory left, and the whole.thing took nothing more than a few hours. sometimes you have to write the piece, sometimes the piece writes itself.. this one was definitely the latter.\n\nInfo taken from: https://www.facebook.com/groups/224103884466178/permalink/227537627456137/",
