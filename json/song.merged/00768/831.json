  "info": "VERSE I (verse II is the same)\n\nit's time to look at stars again,\nstar heals the world,\nit pacifies and lulls to sleep,\n\nit's time to look at stars again,\nstar heals the world,\nat the moment of falling star [people] fall in love\n\nnow time runs and it's hurry up,\nand black night is restless,\nyou could not anymore anticipate:\ndark curls excite me\n\nCHORUS\n\ni shout, i shout because you don't hear,\ni kiss you on mouth,\ni'm free again to beg for sex/love*\n\n*) the very last word of chorus (vonkaamaan) is a slang word which refers to beg for sex or related activities. I guess the origin of the word is in the sounds that cats make when in rut. The lyrics in chorus do not make much sense and leave some questions open (well, the verse doesn't make much sense either).\n\nThanks franz_koopa for the translation",
