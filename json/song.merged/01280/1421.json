Sceners should probably recognise an important inspiration from the track written by [artist]432[/artist] for the Demo [song]2492[/song] realised by Pulse for the Gravity 97. Anyway this a new track, using the same sample set. I was realy fed of waiting and waiting again long weeks before i will be able to see back Delphine.
