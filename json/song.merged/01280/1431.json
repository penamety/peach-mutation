  "info": "Attention, if you are used to fly without logical reason, you should not listen to this track, in case you should never come back on earth…\n\nI was inspirated from the track 1.000.000 miles from Ronny/Teklords found in the PC FUN, and then started this track mixing Dream Music, Vangelis, Moby, with a tripoïd intro, hardcore bassdrum and great SoundFX…\n\nSo Ciao Amigo, i go back to preparing my cases to go to Louvain-La-Neuve… Hope there I could continue writing music, but for now, no computer was planned.\n\nThe CD version included in Esperenza’s album finished with a special vocal : We go on a Trip to Stratos !\n\nProject : Esperenza\nProject Download : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/11973",
