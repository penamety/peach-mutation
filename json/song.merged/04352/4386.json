  "info": "I came in the bar that night\nAnd I saw her standing there.\nShe didn't look like a Rasta,\nBut I didn't really care.\nI got lost in her eyes at once\nAnd I asked her for her name.\nShe said her name was Giana\nAnd that her life was like a game.\n\nOhh...\nOhh...\n\nShe said she must be on her way\nAnd she left me standing there.\nI couldn't close my mouth,\nNo, all I could do was stare.\nI never met such a girl,\nNever think I will meet one again,\nBut she'll be with me in my mind\nAnd I'll keep looking just the same.\n",
