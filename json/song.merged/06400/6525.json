I'm\nnow releasing the song in the Return to Stage 9 musicdisk.\n\nThis is an early, original mix of the song; a newer,\nimproved mix will appear in Epic Megagames' game Unreal\nTournament. Check it out.\n\n\nSamples obtained from:\n\n- Treponem Pal: Higher\n- Think About Mutation: Virus\n- Hannu \"Salomon\" Salonen (thanks!)\n- Teque\n- Vocals by me. --- Kidding. (Thanks to General 6000)\n\n----------------------------\n\nEnter the mutant traitor\nBurning oh so bright\nIn this corrupted nature\nI see no other light\n\n- -\n\nAddicted to radiation\nFueled by your pain\nAroused high by contamination\nSoothed by acid rain\n\n- -\n\nMother nature lied to me;\nBetrayed on a killing spree\nMother nature expelled me;\nWhat's the use now, that I'm free\n\n-----------------------------",
