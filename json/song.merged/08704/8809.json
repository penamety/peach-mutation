Shuffle\n\nthe First Ever Groovy Compo Entry from Virt (sound of crickets chirping)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, I swore off compos, but this one is too big to pass up (And from what I heard, a lot of fun.) Whoever told me that latter part was right! Whee! A whole week to track!\n\nOf course, being the obsessive prick that I am, I started on it Sunday at noon and finished it Sunday at 9. Ugh.\n\nI hope you enjoy it - this one's made with motion in mind, so get up off your ass and dance! :) And TRY not to die while you dance, because we don't want a repeat of what's inside this tune! \n\n-(Hello to all whom I don't yet know; hopefully this'll be a good chance to meet someone new :)\n\n\n-Virt/RootMusic (c)1999 Jacob Kaufman",
