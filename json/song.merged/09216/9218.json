OK engines stop.\nHouston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.\nRoger Tranquillity.\nWe copy you on the ground.\nYou've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.\nWe're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\n\nThe fading day will hide the pain\nAnd knowing you will break the chain\nAs time slows down, the hour draws near\nWe conspire to make it clear\n\nYou'll never find a better time\nto make a stand; You'll be fine\nKnow the game and all it holds\nJust watch it now as it unfolds",
