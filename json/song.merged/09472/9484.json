  "info": "Lyrics:\nChoose no life.\nChoose no career.\nChoose no family.\nChoose a f**king big computer.\nChoose graphic cards, soundcards, hard disks, noisy as washing machines.\nChoose staying up late.\nChoose any kind of cola, salty peanuts and visiting your dentist very often.\nChoose no friends.\nChoose your competitors.\nChoose sitting in front of your computer for the f**king whole day.\nChoose glasses.\nChoose what you're gonna say to your girlfriend when she asks you to get a real life.\nChoose DIY and wondering why the f**k you are coding something senseless on a Sunday morning.\nChoose sitting on a plastic chair watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing demos, stuffing f**king junk food into your mouth.\nChoose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last in a miserable zine, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, f**ked-up lamers gaming industry spawned to replace the computer artist.\nChoose your future.\nChoose scene.\nx2",
