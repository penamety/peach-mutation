  "info": "- 30 Channel IMF (Orpheus' native format)\n- full 16-bit 44kHz multisample support\n- official IMAGO demosong\n\nThis is the demo song that came with Imago Orpheus PC Tracker. Trivia: It actually came with a downsampled version, where the frequency slides were broken. Orpheus makes heavy use of the Chorus, Reverb, and Filter FX of the Soundblaster AWE32 Soundcard which came out in 1993.",
