  "info": "A nice piece featuring a few samples of one of my synthesizers, the SIEL Opera 6. A funny anectode: When I opened the “File Open” Dialog in the SoundTracker to load a high-hat sample, I accidantly clicked on Disk.info (containing some binary metadata) instead of on the real sample. The Disk.info sounded like pure noise - then again, not much different from a real high-hat and so I kept it :)",
