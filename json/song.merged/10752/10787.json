  "info": "dig deep\n303 blowout remix : chuck biscuits / mono\n\nThis started off as an ambient groove and then through some inspiration provided to me via OLN's \"orporto deep cuts\" on Tribal, it transformed into a deep house groove, only to be supplmeneted with the cutting edge of the 303 bassline in this remix. hope you're playing this on a big system, because the doubled kick is large :)\n\nGreets go out to: injekted for the oldskool phat US beats",
