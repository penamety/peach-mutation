  "info": "- compsed by basehead - fm()kosmic()imph()ice -\n.. this is my tribute to art of noise; who are, in my opinion, one of the greatest, and most underrated groups ever...\nthis style is totally a tribute to them... they invented it... and all you a.o.n. fans out there, will recognize the style...\nthe intro is almost an exact copy of \"opus 4\" from 'in visible silence\"...\nanyway, thanks to audiomonster, eon, and a.o.n. themselves for some of these cool samples.\nanyway, this is not meant to be a totally serious song or release... but i hope you like it anyway.\n",
