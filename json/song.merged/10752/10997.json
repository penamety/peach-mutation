  "info": "TDK: \"Funny story about this. So Moonstone was published by Mindscape right, and my first industry job was with Mindscape... On my FIRST day, I heard this chip tune playing in the producers room. I looked in to see why they were playing my chip music, and of course I saw the intro.. I kinda walked out very quietly without saying a work, feeling a bit embarrased, but more worried that they would realise I wrote music and question as to why it was on the crack for one of their games... :D\"",
