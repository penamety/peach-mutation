  "info": "3rd place in combined demo compo at the Ultimate Meeting 2007\n\n\"the (german) text is 100% original from a spam mail that jco received about a month ago (except for the repetitions). not a word was changed, and neither were any of the urls (as spoken). the website is gone for good already, so the whole thing probably was a short-lived scam operation. in any case, the completely fucked up german translation with its unintentional humor was reason enough for jco to make a track out of it, and for me to suggest turning it into a demo :). besides, we both found it hilarious how the job offer crap in the first half slowly turns into the cheesy propaganda-ish phrases full of military metaphors in the second half.\" -ryg",
