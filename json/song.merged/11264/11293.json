I was just born as a human being. And then I learned this whole business of who I am, and whether I'm good or bad, or achieving or not. All that's learned along the way. 2x\n\nAnd, you see all those learned things separate, so you start to have this dissociative experience, of where all that you become is a point of awareness, that's all that's left. I remember the first time this happened to me, I got this terrible panic, because indeed, I was gonna cease to exist.",
