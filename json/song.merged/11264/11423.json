  "info": "My first _EVER_ track which is not made in Amiga!!!!!111!1!! In a real hurry I studied Renoise some weeks before Assembly and made this song as a result (even those _very_ first tracks and notes I inserted into renoise as a test are still part of this song, lol). Superb thanks to BitArts for mastering this tune and helping me with the Renoise effects. I was extremely happy to see that the song got qualified to the finals and was played at the big screen, but at the end it ranked only 14th place after the voting.",
