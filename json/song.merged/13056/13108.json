  "info": "Hewson, 1988\n\nAuthentic recording from Stone Oakvalley's collection.\n\nThis is an R4 SID chip recording. In recordings from R2 and R5 chips guitar samples are completely screwed up.\n\nThe composer was disappointed that instead of Hewson letting him to make music for Amiga port they gave the job for somebody else who allegedly ruined his \"heavy metal ideology\"",
