  "info": "This is the second tune I did for the yet to be released FLT intro called 'Beaufort', and as far as I can remember, the second tune I did with the first VST version of Smash's synth. Despite some obvious flaws in the quality of the instruments and mixing, I like this one. Probably the closest I've come to a ridiculously dramatic theme that some demo groups seem to specialise in.",
