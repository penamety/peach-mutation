  "info": "This title is my favorite personal Amiga mod because it is powerful and melodic with rich percussions that give sensations to the listening. Unlike Ultrasyd who is fed up with Elisa, I'm in love with Paula (the soundchip of the Amiga) ;p Frankly I don't know I did this tune, it was a magical breath :) Comments are welcomed. Enjoy !",
