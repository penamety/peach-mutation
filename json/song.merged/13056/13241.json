  "info": "This is not a tune about werewolves, or living deads, or Michael Jackson ;) It's just like a soundtrack about a strange night under the moonlight. A friend had asked me to make this music for his Amiga's 3D demo . Finally he did not like. The title comes from the name of the recording studio, where one of my favorite rockband \"Extreme\" has made the album \"Waiting for the punchline\", because it was very evocative and poetic. Comments are welcomed. ",
