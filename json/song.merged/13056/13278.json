  "info": "Yet another co-op work with phaser. We feel that the tune captures the 80's feel quite nicely even though the sounds are not as cheesy :) The tune was made in a similar fashion to Minty Flamingo: phaser made most of the composition and I made the leads, fixed some compositional issues which affected the mixing and mixed the tune (of which I'm not too proud of again).",
