  "info": "\"This is the best track of my ancient tracking experimenting. I was always missing something in my tracks but this one seems like it has everything what I wanted in and the core was made in only one night. First version I did on Sound Blaster 2.0 (mono, 8bit), this one is version 1.21 remade on ESS1869 (16bit stereo), in Impulse Tracker. It is little remixed and better stereo tuned. It also won ZPP MOD COMPO in Nov 98.\"",
