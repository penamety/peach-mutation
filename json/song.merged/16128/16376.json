  "info": "That day, master Piek came at home after a long delay… I was alone and then i could focus him on a Fast Tracker seance..\n\nHe had an excellent idea : realising a Demo (production of Demoscene World) with my bros Pype for PPP Team Software, and then we will prepare him a great song… something Funk and Scene… So we began to sample guitare’s riffs from the Pype’s Fender… without amplification, just plug it on my soundcard and add some distortion with Fast Tracker…\n\nIntroduction of dreams was not exceed 1 minutes… it’s a short essai… but I didn’t have enough memory to add more samples… anyway other « parts » will be created later for this dream voyage….",
