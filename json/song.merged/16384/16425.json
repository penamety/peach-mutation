  "info": "1st April, i was that sunday in the Centre Culturel from Seraing for a new concert of the musical academy Léon Deleval where my brother, my sister and my mother will perform… I met there my friend JedD. Listening to the orchestra, i had the idea to mix techno trance song with a philharmonic orchestra… Back at home, i began to work on it !\n\nSure, it was not so easy to do such a song with a small 80386 computer and the Scream Tracker, anyway with some intersting samples i add trumpets, piano, violins, xylophone and flute to my techno sounds and jungle beat… the result is intresting !\n\nI also had the time to watch to the Brazil Grand Prix winnen by Damon Hill on the Williams Renault.\n\nproject : Planer n'est pas jouer\nproject download : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/22103",
