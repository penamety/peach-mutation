  "info": "Another new project for P.P.P. Team Sofware settle by Pype and Pierrick starring a red bubble called Grungee who should solved 3D iso tables painting the ground. Sure it may be a tribute to Qbert, as if at that time i don’t know it… It most remember me a great game on the Amstrad of my friend Xavier. Later i decided to create a Game Maker version of Grungee, so i rebuilt the concept in a 2D classic game with staires and plate-formes. I had made two or three level, but we lost all datas during the june crash. We could remember it with this photo, but also with the three tracks i’ve written for it !\n\nProject name : Grungee",
