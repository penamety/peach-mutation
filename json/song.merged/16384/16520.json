  "info": "Commander Keen, in 1996, it was impossible that no one remember it… also now ! For me, it was THE HIT of ID Software, realy more fun that Doom. I discovered the first episodes on PC with Julien Stassart and Alain Gillon, then i’ve bought the 4th and best one called : Goodbye Galaxy with my Gravis Joypad. In 1992, it was probably the best games in that category on PC MS-DOS, still in 1996 i often played it, and now, i sometime re-install it… and hardly waitin’ an adaptation on the PS3 store.\n\nI re-arranged there some musical theme from Bobby Prince in a funky amiga style around the Mr Keel Theme samples.\n\nSo, do you known that in 1996, our PPP Team Software realised a Game Maker version of Xeen Commander, who’s son of Billy, the hero of Keen Commander.",
