  "info": "\"This song was published in December 1992 with the title name \"Agony Screams\" within the \"Mirror\" music disk, by Andromeda. (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3614) The reason for the title change I think had to do with \"It's so cool\" name was too long for the menu selector or something. Or Mr.Hyde just had fun with renaming my modules maybe. :) I believe the song was composed somewhat earlier 1992, maybe during the summer holiday. I had just bought myself a Yamaha TG-77 synth and a Boss DR660 drum machine, and was so impressed by the fresh sounds - it was \"just so cool\" to compose music again! :) Thinking of remixing this track and update it to MP3 format someday. :)\"",
