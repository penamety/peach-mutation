  "info": "There is a guy I know called Nate\nWho can consume a whole damn crate\nOf Guinness, if he gets the chance,\nWhich proves that he is not from France.\n\nHe resides somewhere in the UK\nWhere it rains every fucking day.\nI'm not sure, I have my doubts,\nBut I think that's why his site's called ???\n\nHooray, a chance for you!\nThere's no guy I'd rather do\nIf I was gay, but since I'm straight\nI'd rather make a song about the guy called Nate.\n\nMetal detectors at Heathrow\nAlways refuse to let him through\n'Cause he's got piercings everywhere,\nKinda like a punk-rock Yogi Bear.\nOh wait, that was a bad rhyme.\n\nIf there was a World Cup in coolness, I'd surely win.\nI rock so radical, but I'm sure Nate would be runner-up.\n\nHooray, a chance for you!\nThere's no guy I'd rather do\nIf I was gay, but since I'm straight\nI'd rather make a song about the guy called Nate.\nHooray, a chance for you!\nThere's no guy I'd rather do\nIf I was gay, but since I'm straight\nI'd rather make a song about the guy called Nate.\nHooray, hooray, for you...\n",
