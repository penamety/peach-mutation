  "info": "\"It was actually composed for my friends 30th birthday. He hates techno and that Tuohitorvi (horn instrument). So of course I had to make a song out of those two elements. We were on a boat and one of the guys had that tuohitorvi with him and they played it (and guitar) couple of days straight. So it's really done in 10 minutes and it's a joke :)\" -PM",
