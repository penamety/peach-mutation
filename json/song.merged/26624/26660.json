  "info": "Echoes features a technique done on the C-64 for the first time. It resamples the SID chip’s 3rd. voice realtime and plays it back with a delay, thereby creating a “fourth” echoed voice. In this tune Geir programmed this technique along with a new version of Macro Player (V2), and composed the song in assembly language during April 2009.",
