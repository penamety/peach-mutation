  "info": "Lyrics:\nWe want to tell about a better place\nThe most marvelous thing you'll ever face\nEndless wonders that never cease to amaze\nBeyond imagination, beyond imagination!\n\nA portal will soon open in the garden\nIt will lead us to our promised haven\nThis is your destiny as women and men\nEnter the next level, enter the next level\n\nWe try to save people from misery\nCome with us we say to the infinity!\nBut it's no use... they just repeat:\nI must continue! Must continue!\n\nNo one else is yet ready to evolve\nIf we want the bliss... we must go alone!\nWe now say goodbye to all the flesh & bone\nIt was nice to know you! It was nice to know you!",
