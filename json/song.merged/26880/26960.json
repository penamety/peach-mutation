  "info": "Based on \"Just Can't Get Enough\" by Depeche Mode\n\nThis has been modified a little, to reduce the stereo separation.\n\n\"Unbearable on headphones.\" Well, there's nothing I can do about that :P\n\nConverted to .wav with VLC's file output module. Adjusted stereo with Audacity, mixed each channel into the other at -12dB. Converted to mp3 with lame -h -b 256.\n\nReal title of this song in the Digital Force musicdisk is \"Surprise\"",
