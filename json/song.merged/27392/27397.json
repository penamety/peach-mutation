  "info": "The happy oldschool tune we've used in a promo demo of this musicdisk on DiHalt 2007 demoparty. Not everyone liked it because people are used to hear minimal dark techno music with such contemporary mixed and edited visuals. This time we intended to break this newschool (ten years old already?) trend and to force you enjoy a classic Amiga styled music with some brutal-coloured visuals :)",
