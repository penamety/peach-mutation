  "info": "The track was made for Star Defender 3 game. It's interesting, that developer suggested to use such synthetic style instead of live-like pathetic guitar/orchestral style, which we used in previous issues of Star Defender game.\nBelieve it or not, \"Synthesed World\" disk and \"BrixOut XP\" game make such music style most wishful among russian shareware game developers :)",
