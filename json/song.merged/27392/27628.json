  "info": "A long-time denizen of the 'tracker' scene, and more recently a videogame musician on titles such as the multi-award-winning Ion Storm opus, \"Deus Ex\", we're delighted to release this great piece of clicked-up electronics from the Boston, US-based Basehead. \n\n\"Beacon\" is a really special piece of clickish-house, with some of the sharpened drums and syncopated rhythms that characterise that particular subgenre. Add the deeper-than-subterranean sub-bass and echo-laden lead lines swimming in and out of the tune-mist, and you end up with a truly original-sounding track which is noticably different to a lot of the lusher, slower material Monotonik has been releasing of late.",
