Better late than never. :)\n\nThe knight looked up and over the fields,\nRed with the blood and guts of his sworn enemy.\nOnce again the good had prevailed and evil been forced back to the flaming pits of the underworld from whence it came.\nWhen he turned around, he realised he was the only man still standing.\nAll his allies had fallen, died by the sword to defend the right,\nAnd, as he walked away towards the horizon, he was truly the last hero.\n",
