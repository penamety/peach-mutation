  "info": "Part of the \"Modern chiptunes/nostalgia\" group of songs.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyp2ueTSxrY\n\n\"Extended version of the earlier ymVST chiptune by popular demand. Sounds are still generated using the ymVST YM2149 emulator, with some delay and gate effects (dblue Glitch) applied to some of the tracks.\n\nSequenced/tracked using Renoise v1.9.\n\nAll sounds were manually programmed and generated using an awesome freeware VST Atari ST sound instrument called ymVST (http://www.preromanbritain.com/ymvst/ ). The gate effect was accomplished by using Glitch VST by dblue.\"",
