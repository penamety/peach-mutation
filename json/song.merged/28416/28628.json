  "info": "Lyrics:\nCertain problems cause computers to get stuck in a particular loop. The loop leads to meltdown, but just before they crash they become “aware” of their own structure.\n\nDeep down they feel that whatever is going to happen there will be someone there to help them. That fills them with hope that there is someone up there, watching out for them.\n",
