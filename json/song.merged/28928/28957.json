  "info": ".story behind the music.\n\n   well, one day I was just browsing the internet like any other day. i\nhadn't been too inspired to write anything outside of lame OHC entries,\nand was starting to get kinda frusterated and gave up. after i wrote\n\"whirlpool of feelings\" with my friend melvyl, i had a big urge to write a\nvery emotional tune, something with a spiffy beat to it, and enough melody\nto keep a listener coming back for more. unfortunately that never\nhappened, but then in hellven's chat room, we started talking about nogsf\nand her wonderful music, as well as some of the other female trackers out\nthere and commending them for churning out some truly elegant music. so\nanyway, i went and downloaded some of nogsf's music, and thought \"holy\ncrap, this stuff is really really good. must have more!\" so i went to her\nsite and got more. ;) the result of listening to it? this song.\n\na remix of \"dr0m i paradis\" (dream in paradise). enjoy.\n\nfrom the bottom of my heart, thanks to nogsf for writing great music, and\nletting me remix her wonderful song. i hope this makes her happy :) also,\nthanks to all my friends in hellven and sstrax that constantly support me\nand keep me going.",
