  "info": "Hello there. Yet another track from skyline/ Dragoon-kun. This is one of\nmy personal favorites...\n\n\nSeeing how many songs were made for the FF series, I decided to do the\nZelda series some justice. I plan on making a lot more in the near future.\nI hope that the tracking I've done lately has improved my style. Until\nthen, enjoy this song!\n\nBest listened to with a KOSS headset along with IT 2.14.",
