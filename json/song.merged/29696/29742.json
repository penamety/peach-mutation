  "info": "Used in \"Ceasefire (all falls down..)\", which ranked 2nd in the demo compo at Assembly 2010.\n\nLyrics:\n\nI believe there might come a time\nWhen the earth will swallow us\nTidal waves will crash our towns\nSending out a million cries\n\n[chorus]\nAnd it could all fall down\nAnd it could all fall now\nWe could all fall apart in crashing cars\nAnd never be right here\n\nWho will stand when the comets drop\nThrough a sky that looks down on us\nEquality will be crowned that day\nWhile leaving us in a guilty rage\n\n[chorus]",
