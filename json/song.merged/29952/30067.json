  "info": "Blue Street\nel blanco [fulcrum]\na hair over 3 minutes (like 3:05)\n\nGreetz to fulcrum members, especially Coplan! Yannick for making FT2, old skool #trax-ers and the rest.\n\nThis song has quite a few firsts for me. It's my first tune since joining [fulcrum], my first Mad Tracker 2 tune, and the first new song I've written in like...5 years.\n\nIt's a bit slow, but so am I now that I'm getting older. Enjoy.",
