  "info": "Created - February X, 2003\nI was listening to some random track once, and the way the melody was going, I thought it was going to turn out to be a disco remix of a song from Chrono Trigger. Then I listened to the song for 10 seconds and it went in a completely different direction. But that got me thinking -- a disco remix of that song from Chrono Trigger would sound pretty awesome. So I made Turn Back Time, a medley/remix of four songs from Chrono Trigger. It was originally released to chiptune.com and later released in the Big Chip Compo #5, where it took 1st place in the Remix category. ",
