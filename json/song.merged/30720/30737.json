  "info": "Original JP title: ア○ニーラブだもん。 Joke entry, entered in Famicompo Mini vol.6's original section. \n\nProbably based on a true story, this is a heart-breaking tale between a teacher and his mischevious pupil's seductive pleas for some good ol' long-time traditional Japanese finger-clasping. \n\nShameless pastiche of early 90s R&B wank I used to listen to in the radio from the likes of Jodeci, Shai, Keith Sweat, and R. Kelly. That, and series like Kodomo no Jikan. Hmmm, and also certain books I managed to buy in Toranoana one fateful day. With surprising traps underneath. Yep. \n\nOriginal format: NSF (2A03 + VRC6). \nLyrics (japanese + english): http://www.nanjamonja.com/muzak/ananierabudamon_scenario.txt ([url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815192732/http://www.nanjamonja.com/muzak/ananierabudamon_scenario.txt]Web Archive[/url])\n\nNote: \"Anal love\" is an incorrect translation for the name of this song. The artist does not approve that.",
