  "info": "A fun little moesong cover jingle loop from one of Mayumi Shindou's earlier works, 「ツいてて☆ラッキー」, done in only NES RP2A03 without DPCM.\n\nThis orignally spawned as an inside joke during another project I was working on last year. At the day of Famicompo Mini vol.7's deadline, I eventually decided to re-visit it just for fun. And after much frustration and cursing at famitracker's not-so-fun exporting screwups, I sucessfully submitted it as a last-minute \"classical\" cover entry. It eventually got 6th place out of 67 overall.\n\nOnly occasionally do I dive into capcom-style technique, so I think I was successful in preventing most people from knowing who made this. The song's subject matter, on the other hand, uhhh... :D\n\nTrue story: The incomplete version of this was played in Sofmap Akihabara in front of not only Mayumi Shindou and her fans, but also MOSAIC.WAV (!!!).\n\n(yes i know i keep referencing them all the time but then again if you hate their music you are a cruel deranged person and must also be a dirty terrorist).\n\nLater on that day I kept playing cumshotty jingles keyjazzed off my laptop keyboard via a tracker with them while dressed in lolita attire. I am seriously not lying.",
