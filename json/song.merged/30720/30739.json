  "info": "ull name (due to 8bc's uploader acting like a complete butt on japanese characters): 「お兄ちゃんだからいいよ〜♪ ('Pheromone OVERDOSAGE Mix' part)」. part of an ongoing pastiche-remix series based on a particular older tune i've made. fairly simplistic electro house wankoff loop (topped with atrociously repetitive chord progression & fake autotune awfulness), conceived & made in a complete rush during a wednesday morning -- which was originally intended for a live set later on that day. plain vanilla nes 2a03-only.
