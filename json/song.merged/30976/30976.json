  "info": "\"Music for the Byterapers Reneissance demo is a mixture of outboard gear\nand ITB orchestral libraries.  One of the outboard gear I used is my all\ntime favourite Studio Electronics ATC-X analogue monosynth which I ran\nthru either Moogerfooger lowpassfilter, Frostwave Resonator (Low Pass\nFilter) or Ibanez TS9DX distortion pedal.  I also used fully loaded Korg\nTriton and it was used to the C64-like lead sounds and the electronic\ndrums you hear on the piece.  Tritons sounds were again processed thru\nthe filters mentioned.   Orchestral libraries I used were mostly Project\nSAM brass/True Strike and for strings and woods I used Vienna Special\nEdition Libraries.  The rest of the instruments (to double or to use\nindividually) were from the EWQLSO Platinum Library..  I used Protools\nLE for midi editing and then the tracks were mixed our  studio (Protools\nHD3 + outboard). (Watch out for the StereoVersion!!)   Nelli Nyman spoke\nthe text written by Grendel.  I think that this also adds a very nice\ndimension to the demo..\n\nI really wanted to combine the \"oldschool\" sound with some modern\nclassical elements to respect the old and to add something new.\"",
