  "info": "This tune was partly inspired by the title tune of a relatively old PC game called \"My Teacher is an Alien\". It was made with FL Studio 9, mostly using Audjoo Helix which is a fantastic VST. I tried to do it in a sort of 80's style, as a sort of cartoon intro tune or something like that.",
