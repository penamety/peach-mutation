  "info": "This is a simplish synth track of mine with that spacey feeling everyone loves. From the beginning it was designed to be simple but nice to listen; and I can tell you, it was one hell of fun composing this. I loved choosing the instruments (me lovez teh bellz!) and couldn't drive the melodies out of my head for days. Actually, the whole thing was made during only a few of that sunny holiday home-alone days, waiting for my girlfriend to arrive. The sun was hot, water cool, and I flooded the air with some 80s sounds. That was not particularly deliberate, but looking back â€“ yeah, it does sound like 80s. And who doesn't just love 80s with its synthesized drums, 4/4 beat, saw leads and echoing bells?",
