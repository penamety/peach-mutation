It ended up as #4 in the compo. That seems fair.\n\nIt was made with mostly (only?) sounds from ST-01 and ST-02 (that means Amigaaaaa 1987), and encoded in 80kbps to hide the lamer sound of Renoise. Lol-yeah-ölollö!\n\nAlso performed live and was interviewed by one of the authors of MusicLine (best ‘chip’-tracker, except for LSDj and Defmon?). Find the recordings on “internet”.\n\n[URL=http://goto80.com/blog/storm-rave-st-01]GOTO80[/URL]",
