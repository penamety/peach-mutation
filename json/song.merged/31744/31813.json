  "info": "The cracktro sported a huge FLT logo in the middle with little scrollies at the top and bottom.  There was a basic 3-level parralax starfield in the back and that music was playing all the while.\n\nNot sure if it was Fairlight or some other knock-off.. I never could rip the song out or even find who did the song.",
