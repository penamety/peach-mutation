  "info": "This is a vocoder version of One More Time.\n\nIt took a lot of work to be done, both because of poor recording conditions and because it is the first track in which I made vocoder vocals.\n\nRecording the vocals wasn't that problematic, each verse took a few attempts, but that was OK. The horrible nit-picking part was syncing the vocoder notes to the vocal track. That was very exhausting and took a lot of trial-and-error hours. It still isn't perfect, but the quality is good enough, I think.\n\nThat being said, I made a huge leap forward, for this is really the first track where I incorporated my own vocals, and at the same time the first track where I made proper use of a vocoder as such.\n\nFrankly, I don't want to see this song for a little while \n\n14 Feb 2011",
