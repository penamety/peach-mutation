  "info": "I was born between factory walls.\nI was conceived among the ivory halls;\nAnd in this world I knew my role.\nI went to work with a single goal.\nI travelled the Earth to far-off lands,\nFrom the Asian jungles to the African sands.\nI flew in planes of camouflage green\nBefore I settled upon this scene.\nLike a shooting star, I came to rest,\nAnd this farmer's field is where I nest,\nWatching the seasons come and go,\nWatching the long grass grow and grow.\n\nThe years pass by and I lay here still,\nFor my purpose is clear for me to fulfil.\nThe sun was out, it was the middle of May\nWhen the farmer's three children came out to play.\nThey ventured near; I lay in wait.\nOne unknowing step sealed their fate.\nOne thousand shards of plastic rose\nFrom where I lay and through their clothes,\nInto their bodies the shrapnel sank,\nHere in this field, by a river bank.\nThe blood poured down, shone in the sun,\nAnd one cluster bomblet's job was done.\n",
