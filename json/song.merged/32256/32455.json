  "info": "\"The Peanut Fiend\"\n\nBy Aymes.fromage\n\nFor the Outpost KO compo 2 (round 1)!!! www.outpostmusic.com\n\nI hope i get through, but at least it forced me to track once more :D\n\nThis disturblingly titled tune is, imo, a terribly frightening mixture of\nway too much Gunbound and Final Fantasy playing mixed in with my own insanity.\nI hope you like :D\n\nThis was written with the amazing \"Cheese Tracker\" by Reduz, for anyone who\nprefered to write music in Impulse Tracker but dont like Mpt in Windows I\ncant recommend it enough!!\n\nSo on that note, HUGE greets to the man Reduz! Also for his pointers on volumes\nfor this.\nAlso big greets to Slashman, Elky, Aulin, Gopher, Metasonix and all you others\nwho actually talk to me!!\nGreets to the outpost krew for organising this compo, its coolies\n\nSomeone needs to organise a tracking party godamnit.\n\n-out-",
