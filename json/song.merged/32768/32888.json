  "info": "“Paralyzed” was composed during late nights by Jeroen Tel (WAVE) and Thomas Mogensen (DRAX) of Maniacs of Noise. The tune builds around the chromatic movements of the main chord theme. We tried to capture the feeling of being desperately stuck in a situation where -no matter what you do- you can’t seem to do the right thing. The name of the song, “Paralyzed”, refers to an emotional state of feeling desperately paralyzed even to the extent of claustrophobia.",
