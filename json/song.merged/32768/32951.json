  "info": "Heh, what to say. It's been a loooong time since I did ANY scene related work. The task to create a track for this great compilation came really refreshing. Throwing away the commercial based music routine approach, I was free to let the track take it's natural course from the first chord. Although it was heavily inspired by the recent TRON soundtrack (I'm sure you noticed ;)) I didn't want to constrain myself in any way, and just let it come together in this hybrid kind of way. Although utilizing symphonic elements with electronica is nothing new, I just like both worlds. Now mixing and orchestrating this was a bit of pain in the ass, since I don't really have much experience with it. But it was a fun and creative process overall. Thanks to Ziphoid and the SceneSat crew for making this possible! Hope to see you in another great project. Signing off. //Dafunk",
