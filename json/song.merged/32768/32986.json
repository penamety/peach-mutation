  "info": "\nMade using ableton 6, quite a fair few vsti's including a vanguard, z3ta and that sort of thing. Yet more cut up drumloops i've got floating about and more beer (beer is always very important in these operations).\n\nIt's basically my little journey through a genre that I dont really touch on much anymore and came around entirely by accident (especially the final section which you \"Might\" recognise from somewhere else) .. I quite enjoyed making it so hopefully you'll enjoy listening to it. \n\nShouts to everyone at scene sat, remix 64, retro remakes, alex aris, ovine, retrospec, psytronik, all the spanish remakers ive worked with who's names are too numerous and well.. spanish for my pathetic english brain to remember (but they know who they are), my friends on facebook, anyone thats a fan, my twitter buddies, dan franklin, bassline junkie, anyone who has ever supported the scene, and even those that don't and this time I'll add all my family and friends and especially Donella who without her sunny disposition I would definitely be a much more angry man (And if you've ever read some of my facebook/twitter rants you'll know the idea of me being more angry is quite a scary prospect).
