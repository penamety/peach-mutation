  "info": "ZX Spectrum 48K with AY-interface. Italo-disco - good music for summer. \n\n3 digital channels in 4-bit quality. I must admit I even like this one, as it's interesting impression to hear such a sound from a computer in size of a bigger calculator. \n\nSoft used: SAMPLE-TRACKER. There is only about 34Kb for entire \"MOD\" song. Well, it's not a real MOD, as it has only 3 channels and also it has no volume-commands. To trick it, I made most of samples in two versions - louder and more silent, to achieve delays. Of course it took much more RAM, so I had to make the samples even more carefully. AY/YM chip isn't in fact supposed to play samples, so the procedure is based on CPU mostly. I managed here to make an impression of 4 channels by putting samples very nifty. \n\n\"Kaminari\" comes from Japanese language and it means \"thunder\". \n\nRecorded from real hardware.",
