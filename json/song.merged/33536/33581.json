  "info": "I've seen the big picture on this one. It's almost megalomaniac, but hey, I want to hit hard this time. What better that a piece of \"electro-chipmetal\" for that? I wanted to compose this kind of tune since I discovered 8bit Graveyard by Ultrasyd. So I've put all my energy and my heart in the tracker. It was a tough process in front of my screen. Six months of work, 52 patterns, 19843 notes, 25 cases of beer, 120 pizzas, Dexter season 4 missed ;)) F***ing shit, that's what I love, find out what the song is, despite myself. I play with notes to cause the emergence of something in the bits. Just follow a star. The headbanger in me came out too! The color of hell or paradise! Here is the Rockmonitor Law. SONG DETAILS : Prelude / Chapter I : The Ride / Chapter II : Wonder Strike / Chapter III : Unfair Battle / Chapter IV : 1000 Jewels / Outro /. Speakers suggested.",
