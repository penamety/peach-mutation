  "info": "1st place in combined demo compo at Assembly 2011\n\nLyrics:\n\n\nI am spinning out of control\ndrinking my dark side on a moon patrol\nDropping an anchor on a concrete floor\nthe links are dragging me out of the door\n\nCan I close my eyes and see?\nCan I disappear and be?\nCan I play the absentee,\nIn this cage I built for me?\n\nCan I stand up where I fell?\nCan I spiral in my shell?\nCan I cast a binding spell,\nOn this winding road to hell?\n\nI am spinning against the wall\ngrabbing on corners when I feel so small\ngive into impulse as I drop the ball\nbreaking the habits I cannot recall\n\nCan I close my eyes and see?\nCan I disappear and be?\nCan I play the absentee,\nIn this cage I built for me?\n\nCan I stand up where I fell?\nCan I spiral in my shell?\nCan I cast a binding spell,\nOn this winding road to hell?\n\nI am spinning and the world is still\npointing the finger on the things I feel\nyou find me exhausted and crawling uphill\nto colorful nightmares against my will\n\n\nCan I close my eyes and see?\nCan I disappear and be?\nCan I play the absentee,\nIn this cage I built for me?\n\nCan I stand up where I fell?\nCan I spiral in my shell?\nCan I cast a binding spell,\nOn this winding road to hell?\n\nCan I burn my wings and fly?\nCan I justify a lie?\nCan I turn my back and cry?\ncan I be there when I die?",
