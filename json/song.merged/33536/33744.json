  "info": "Had this as a MOD years ago and just recently found this MP3 of it. No idea who the author is or where it came from, bit think it was called 128beats.mod back then. Sorry for the lack of info, but I was unable to find it in the current list of songs either and think its worthy of listing. Thanks.",
