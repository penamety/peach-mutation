  "info": "A Ballad for Diana\". This track is a sad and romantic piece I composed for my girlfriend, who was about to return from her studies in Paris, where she spent 4 previous months.\n\nThe opening theme was a one-shot improvised idea, and after resting for a few weeks I went on and made this track in three nights.\n\nThat's about it, let the music tell the rest :)\n\nMay 28, 2011",
