  "info": "Last night before the compo deadline I decided to enter. Having never used Renoise before, I downloaded the demo version and made this \"song\", which was indeed a remix of Lost Patrol :)\nSorry for quality loss. This is because I had didn't have full version of Renoise to save wav file out to for mp3 encoding. \nSamples used are all stock Renoise samples.\nNeed to re-encode and improve this song overall :)\n",
