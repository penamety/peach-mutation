  "info": "This song, originally just a short organ theme, slowly evolved over time, and became a composition that is very special to me.\n\nQuite a lot of time and effort was put into it. Experiments with various chord progressions were endless, and the whole experience was very enjoyable.\n\nOnce again I let go of synthesizers for a while, and settled with just a handful of sounds to explore harmonic and melodic possibilities rather than sonic ones.\n\nI learned a lot of things, it was fun, and I like the result very much. While composing, memories of my trip to Paris kept surfacing, so I gave the song its name only naturally :)\n\nFinished on November 13th, 2011",
