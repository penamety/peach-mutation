  "info": "Originally done in 2001 on Octamed Soundstudio it got released as a single mp3 on the Moods Plateau Label.\n\nIt is more or less an inofficial Drum & Bass Dub cover of DJ Chemistry & Jack Smooth's track \"Alchemy\" released on Homegrown Records in 1994.\n\nTen years later in 2011, when I decided to have some of my stuff pressed on vinyl, this was chosen to become the B-Side to Mental Climax. So I took up the project again, migrated it to DBM and overworked it.\n\nDownload links:\n- mp3 (320 kbps): [url=http://www.rowdyclub.de/necta/d0dge-City2Suburbia.mp3]City 2 Suburbia[/url]\n\n- DBM Module: [url=http://www.rowdyclub.de/necta/d0dge-C2S.lha]as LHA archive[/url]",
