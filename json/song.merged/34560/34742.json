  "info": "[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST/Amiga_Format]ST/Amiga Format[/url] was perhaps the biggest Amiga magazine in the UK in the early 90's, and mr Brimble did some special music for their \"bonus disks\" attached to the mags. I remember this mod was used together with a picture made by Rico Holmes, who later collaborated in several game projects under the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team17]Team 17-Bit Software[/url] label.\nThis demo came with Issue 3, October 1989.\n\n/pwl",
