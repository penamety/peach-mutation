  "info": "More Italodisco. One Night With You is another step closer to perfection when it comes to imitating the 80s eurodance style.\n\nThis track evolved quite a lot, I made and discarded at least three different starting ideas until I was satisfied and carried on with the rest of the track. But it was worth it.\n\nThe song implements basically everything Michiel Van der Kuy used in his late '80s production. Again, authentic synthesizers and samples were used; arranged in a standard italo song structure.\n\nI doubt it's possible to get even closer without copying the actual melodies (which I did not). Imitation of style is one thing, but keeping it original is as much important.\n\nThe track itself was composed during ~4 days just before Christmas 2011. As usual, many hours of listening, and thorough research of 80s material was needed. But at the same time, much experience was gained!\n\nI'll stop here, and let the music take you back to the 80s. Just sit back, and listen to that synth brass; spacey bells and syncleads; mighty stabs; and driving basslines. :)\n\nFinished on 22 December 2011.",
