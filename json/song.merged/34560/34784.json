[x2]\n\nWatch out, look around \nTo celebrate a life where all are free \nWatch out, look around \nLove is coming feeling around \nWatch out, look around \nlove is coming feeling around \nWatch out, look around \nfeel the love, feel the love, feel the love is a wonderful dream\n\nA wonderful dream... [x2]\n\nNow the children's eyes are shining \nLike they never shone before \nLet their dreams and aspirations light our way \nLiving life in harmony forever more \n\nA wonderful dream...",
