  "info": "I got home late\nAnd I found your note on the kitchen table\nThe writing so perfect\nThere's no sign of emotion\nThe words inside\nBlurred from tears in my eyes\nYou said that were leaving\nAnd you said that you'd tried\n\nOh why, did you have to leave\nYou might as well stick a knife in my heart\nAnd leave me to die\nWhy did you have to leave\nIt feels like you've stabbed me in the heart\nWhen you left me to die\n\nWell there's nothing left to say\nFor too many things have already been said\nAnd if I can't make you love me\nThen I guess it has to end here\nGave no reasons, made no accusations\nDon't know why you want to leave me\nBut it's too late to fight for you\n\nOh why [tell me why], did you have to leave\nYou might as well stick a knife in my heart\nAnd leave me to die\nWhy [tell me why] did you have to leave\nIt feels like you've stabbed me in the heart\nWhen you left me, you left me to die",
