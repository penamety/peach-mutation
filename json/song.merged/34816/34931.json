  "info": "This song is yet another one in the long series of italo disco tracks. This time it's much less Hotsound-ish, but still keeps its 80s style.\n\nI'm particularly proud of the fat bassline and bending lead, but the percussions were also given much love. Maybe the melodies aren't the best, but the sounds...oh yeah! \n\nThe whole thing was done in a week during the winter examination period of 2012, spending a few hours in the evening with some italodance after studying \n\nFinished on Jan 9 2012",
