  "info": "This is the first of two tracks that I've composed for this excellent Scenesat release.\nOriginally, the tune was supposed to be accompanied by a demo. However, the demo wasn't finished so I decided to release it here as a standalone track. It's a pretty straightforward demo tune that was supposed to go along with crazy camera flying and a generally hard and tekky atmosphere. Repetitiveness for FTW!\n\n\"Lyrics\":\n\"At the end of the synthesis I got in a very strange psychic situation.. A kind of dream world appeared. A feeling of oneness with the world. A very strange experience which reminded me of experiences I had in childhood.\" (A quote from Albert Hoffman on his experiences with LSD)",
