  "info": "Second part of 'The Assault'. Also inspired by music from the movie \"The Rock\" composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick-Glennie Smith and Hans Zimmer. \n\nI've also tried to capture the movie atmosphere in this song, and it is divided into seperate parts attempting to portray different scenarios in a movie. This song is in my opinion better technically performed than the \"First Stage\" (stereo effects and so on).\n\nMost samples are identical to the ones in 'The Assault - First Stage', and are \"borrowed\" from the Lizardking song \"Age of Legends\".",
