  "info": "MAS_UTrack_V003 The Lair Of The Orange Machine  By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs\n   --------------------------------\nWritten on or about Mar/94.  (c)\n  This song took insanely long  to write, especially considering that it is rather small.  It did spend a lot of time on the back burner waiting for UltraTracker to get a Jump command.  I hope  one comes out soon, but I've    decided that this song was a pot that I'd been staring at far too long.  If I finish it, perhaps  it will boil, and UltraTracker  will get a Jump command.  It's a luck thing I'm trying here, so  don't break the mojo.\n             Anyways, as I was blathering  above, this song's been about in my \"to be completed\" directory  for a while.  I believe that it dates back to the days of the   original UltraTracker 1.0 (most of my sample archive has since  become UWF files).\n                I hope you enjoy the song.      I'd like to continue to fill  your life with my vast wisdom,  but I've just run out of space.\n   Gotta speed, keid...\n                          Killer Fish     ",
