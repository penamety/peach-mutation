It was done seriously, as i enjoy tracking with one sample, but i of course knew it would end up in bottom bunch, not in top, so it's not a serious effort compowise, if you know what i'm talking about :D Title is Zeta because i didn't have any tune beginning with \"Z\".\n\nOh yeah, the \"transition\" in 1:49 or so is not an accident but done intentionally :)",
