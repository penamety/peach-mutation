  "info": "From [url=http://www.mazedude.com/aa/]The American Album[/url]\n\nTrack # 15 from my epic \"American Album\" remix project. The idea with this one was to take the Map 30 / Opening to Hell theme from Doom 2, and make it sound like it was actually being played in hell. Crackling fire, screams, howls of torment, and so on. It also takes the creepy sine-wave theme and ratchets it up several notches into the realm of industrial insanity.\n\nOriginal theme by Bobby Prince.",
