Pianist and weatherman John Pohlman retires to play spiffy piano jazz and unremittingly listen to Psilodump during his long-awaited vacation, tuned in with his venerable portable travel radio. After 30 years, Pacman finally finds a qualified metronome to aid him in his training towards eating pac-dot-nom's in unmitigated on-target sync with even the most adequate techno rave beats around. His iron determination is undisputed! As for Psilodump, the new year only heralds supplementary adventures beyond challenge!\"",
