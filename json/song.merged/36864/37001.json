  "info": "\"Beacon\"\nWritten by Novus\nReleased for Sound Devotion\n16-bit version released on Thursday, September 30th, 1999.\n8-bit version released on Sunday, March 19th, 2000.\n\nFor this 8-Bit Mix of \"Beacon,\" I mixed all of the 16-bit samples down to\n8-bit and then cut out the whispered vocals and the sound effects. I'm not\nnearly as happy with this version of \"Beacon\" as I am with the\nfull-quality 16-bit version, but a lot of people were balking at\ndownloading a 2-meg file, and I realized I had to be practical.\n\nI will say this, though... although very few people have downloaded the\n16-bit version of \"Beacon,\" none of them have regretted it. So, if you\nenjoyed this mix, you ain't heard nothing yet. Go to my web page and get\nthe 16-bit version. You won't be sorry.",
