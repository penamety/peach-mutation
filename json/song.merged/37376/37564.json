I've always admired Jakim's writing\nstyle, so he was my first choice.  Most of the leads you hear\nare Jakim's; I did more of the \"rhythm\" stuff.  I like how this\none turned out.  I hope to do more!\n\nJakim: I felt kinda strange when I had to change style of this\nmodule to something different. That was a desecration of previous\nmood. But it has turned to something new, maybe even unexpected.\nAh, there is Something Else. Pip Malt's ending is so lovely :).\n\n<<>>---------------<<>>\n",
