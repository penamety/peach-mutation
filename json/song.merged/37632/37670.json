  "info": "These are XM modules that use no (or very few) chiptune elements. Most of these are pretty old (dating back to 2006), and some were \"slightly\" edited before their release onto the web. Again, all of these were made using Modplug tracker, so Modplug is recommended to play the XMs:) NB: If a song has 2 dates, then the first date refers to the month in which it was created, and the second refers to the month in which it was released.
