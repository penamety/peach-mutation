Famicompo Mini 8 entry. 2nd Place! :D\n\nI've just realised I haven't made an mp3 of this available anywhere yet... better fix that. I guess I should also start uploading my music is more places, especially now that 8bc is dead (temporarily, hopefully)\n\nBy the way, I'm fully aware that Dandelion is spelt wrong... unfortunately, I didn't realise this when I submitted the file in the first place, and cba to change it\"\n\n2012 Creative Commons CC Attribution Noncommercial No Derivative Works (BY-NC-ND)",
