  "info": "[b]original comments :[/b]\nWell.. there are more than One year that i've made and posted remix of video games.. not that i don't want to do.. but i've switched from my old Impulse Tracker (running under MS Dos) to Buzz Tracker.. so i need time to learn and try ;p\n\nIn few days i'll launch my new album \"Just a smile\" and i decided to realise a video game mix to include in it. So i've choose the forest theme of Donkey Kong Country 2 that i've heard in some other remix this year, and that have an intersting melody.\n\nso here is.. concept of the album is turning under theme of \"Miss Eskimo\" and her \"Sound Palette\"... so that's why it called Boreal Forest,.. and sounds like this ;p\n\nso.. if u like this remix.. may be u'll like my forcoming album .. then stay tuned on http://cyborgjeff.untergrund.net in few days..
