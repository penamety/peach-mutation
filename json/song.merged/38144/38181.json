  "info": "Hi everyone!  I am back, and I got a new song I made in just 4 hours!\nI hope you enjoy this little peice, it sounds quite odd does it not?\nI like it a lot, and I dedicate it to all the clickers out there I know!\nThe tune was supposed to be a cafe tune for a game, but it didn't quite\nsound like it, and I said \"This reminds me of the Click Cafe\" and there!\nIs my title.  Hope you enjoyed the song everyone,\n\n-Nobuyuki\n\n__________________\nLinks:\n\nhttp://www.3ee.com/cafe\nhttp://www.modarchive.com/artists/nobuyuki\nhttp://welcome.to/8.3.Technologies\n__________________\nGreetings:\n\nCaneHead: I love climber!\nNick: DM forever!\nLeion: Keep at it!\nK-Styles: Nice MOD, RingShadow will rule!\nAnd the Click + MOD community as a whole!\n\n__________________\n\nBring us closer together!
