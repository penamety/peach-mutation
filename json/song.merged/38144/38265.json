Oddly, inspired by the Po\nkemon\nPlatinum battle scene against one of the legendary pokemon (no mocking, it's a g\nood game!)\nMade in only a couple of days;...whoa! I'm speedy:D\n\nSamples from aceman and K.Koch, and others from various artists.\n\nYou know who you are...oh, and enjoy!\n\n(also, my first chiptune that doesn't really use any guitar or synth samples:) T\nhe strings\nin this one are unused, and sorry that the ending's a bit sudden, i'm never good\n at\nendings:P)",
