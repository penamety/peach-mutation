  "info": "[i][b]Punqtured's comments:[/b][/i]\n\nThis one was inspired by a remix of Smack my bitch up, that Lug00ber played at Kindergarden 2012. I wanted to try and recreate that nasty bassy sound and the nice breakbeat. Not sure I succeeded as much as I'd hoped. But I'm definitely happy with this one, and hope all of you will enjoy this.\n\nGreat thanks to the organizers of Revision!\nYou're doing an amazing job for everyone to have this awesome party-experience.\n\nAgain, I have to compliment the organizers for the free coffee. That's what really keep us going when deadline is closing in!\n\n\nHope you enjoy and ...\n\nP A N T S    O F F",
