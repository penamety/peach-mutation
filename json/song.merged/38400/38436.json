  "info": "ZX Spectrum 128 AY-3-8912 3 channel music, ACB stereo separation. Composed in SQ-Tracker, ran out of its pattern capacity so finished the song using Vortex Tracker II (God thanks for its SQT import function). Quite hard work to learn mastering VT. Recorded from the real ZX Spectrum 128 +2.\n\nPlaced 1st at the Revision 2012 Oldskool Executable Music compo. Thank you guys for your votes!",
