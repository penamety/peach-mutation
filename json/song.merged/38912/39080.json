  "info": "[b]Cons' comments:[/b]\n\nThis is the demoscene pre release of my new track. There will be some minor changes after the party because they couldn't be implemented in time. Again this is not the \"regular\" demoscene sound, but something I would like to have you think about for more than just the moment it is played in the competition. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did creating it. Thanks again to my dear friend Ellina for her vocals.\n\nThey are awesome and make the track sound like I wanted it to do.\n\nOver and out.",
