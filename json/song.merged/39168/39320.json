  "info": "Just a small funky/jazzy song that comes from my 2013 album \"Microsongs\" that can be listened from here: http://cheapbeatsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/microsongs\nI made it for ZX Spectrum 16K with AY-interface but of course 16K is too small ram for a reasonable tracker, so the song has been composed on ZX Spectrum 48K + AY-interface (ZX SoundTracker 1.1).\nRecorded from real hardware.\n\nPS: \"Ai\" means \"Love\" in Japanese. :) The album has been released by Japan-based label CheapBeats (Tokyo).
