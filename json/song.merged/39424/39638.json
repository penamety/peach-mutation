  "info": "The original idea/outline of the work and the instruments were made by SuperNoise.\nThen I joined in :) I compressed Supernoise's 5 minutes into 2 minutes, re-arranged everything, reworked drums, piano.\n\nThen I added a dubstep interlude ;D\n\nThe worst thing was to come up with the outro - I lacked ideas.\nThat's why it is IMO the weakest part of the song.\n\n- AceMan\n\nAll samples based on sound synthesis.\nVST instrument used for sound generation: Zebra2, Z3ta+, ARP2600, uTonic, Analog Warfare 2.5, Arch Avenger Pro, Massive, TyrellN6, FM8, V-Station, Moog Modular.\nDSP Chain: Renoise DSP plugins, Classic Auto-Filter, Classic Delay, TLs2095-LA,MEqualizer, TLs-3127, TAL Reverb 2, D-16 Redoptor, Reacomp.\n\nThis tune got #2 place in streaming music competition @ WeCan 2013.",
