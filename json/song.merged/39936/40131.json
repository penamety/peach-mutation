  "info": "\"Convalescence\" - Pop/Ambient - 8:33\n\nThis was my debut track for my netlabel hellven. Written and produced in 2 days, this is the first track of mine featuring singing. I wish the vocals were produced better but unfortunately I was facing hardware problems at the time! This track was warmly received by our listeners though, and I'm satisfied with it, even though it's much more \"Pop\" oriented than what I would normally do.",
