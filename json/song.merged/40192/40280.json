  "info": "Born to stand against the wind, to struggle on my own\nAgainst the countless masses I will fight until I'm gone\nBlackened, betrayed, tortured, forgotten and alone\nA thousand lies I've faced, but I will bow to none\n\nThey hate me for what I am, unsubdued and free\nWith cunning, stealth and might, I will not kneel\n\nI sing of freedom, metal and might\nFreedom, metal and might\nWhen invaders come to kill us all, only agents dare to fight\nTo fight for freedom, metal and might\n\nMy mind is in turmoil, my eyes are burning bright\nThrough devouring rage and anger, I'm getting ready to fight\nThe desperate cries of fallen brothers still echo in my head\nFooled by the lies of those in command till the price of blood was paid\n\nThe sceptics and the tyrants will claim we're bound to fail\nBut with burning will and power we will prevail\n",
