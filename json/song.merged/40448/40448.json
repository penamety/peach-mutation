  "info": "BEAM is a group of talented musicians with different styles and different \nbackgrounds. The thing we all have in common is the will and courage to \nexperiment with a handful of notes fetched from within our minds, and a \ncompilation of rhythms rendered from our inner heartbeat. \n\nEach musician creates his/her own unique sound which we hope you will learn\nto enjoy. In addition to experimental tracks we also carry musicians that \noccasionally release more commercial tracks which do not require a serious\nlistener. \n\nWithin our selection of tracks I'm sure you will find a track that suit \nyour own style.",
