  "info": "Track 10 in the Hysterical Chipdisk. The most developed piece in the musicdisk, but still short, clocking in at just over a minute. Taking full advantage of some cheap and cheerful Casio drumsounds. Major scale intro & outro with the main parts of the song utilising a repetitive minor scale riff.\n\nReleased originally in March 1997.\n\nCheck traxinspace for the entire disk.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
