  "info": "Track 11 in the Hysterical Chipdisk. The song with the most driving riff, the most foot-tapping of the Hysterical collection, based around a line that would be at home in a hard rock song. Deliberate hard panning of bass left and drums right, with the arpeggio and melody gluing it together in the middle.\n\nReleased originally in March 1997.\n\nCheck traxinspace for the entire disk.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
