  "info": "A 15-song suite as twenty two minute chiptune piece. To be released at some untold time in the future as the A-side of a vinyl LP.\n\nEvery song uses the same set of chip samples in a different way, and it only has four channels for the entire file.\n\nPossibly the most unconventional use of Impulse Tracker for me up until this point. I intentionally produced this to sound like it flows as an entire album suite, so each song works itself as an intro to the next. I guess you could say, each section is a vignette of a larger picture. One of my favourite pieces because of the catchiness of each part formed as a whole, and the extended use of the chiptune form. \n\nI wrote almost all of the pieces on a two string bass guitar over the space of a couple of days, and tracked it over the space of three weeks.\n\nCheck traxinspace for more tunes.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
