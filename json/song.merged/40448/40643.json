  "info": "142bpm chiptune-based song with saxophone and nylon string guitar, and a very funky beat. I like how the ending section is totally different to the main section of the song. I did a lot of work on this song, and it's one of my favourite tunes I wrote in MultiTracker.\n\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
