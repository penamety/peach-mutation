  "info": "The song was introduced as the national anthem of Soviet Union in 1944. New lyrics were introduced in 1977 removing references to the Second World War and Stalin. Russian Federation adopted the song as its national anthem in 2000, again with new lyrics (they had tried another song between the years 1990-2000 but it failed to get enough popularity)",
