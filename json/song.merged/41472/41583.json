  "info": "The song written in one evening on a rainy August day when I was sitting home-alone and had no distractions. My trusty 7-year old iMac ran out of CPU power towards the end, so it's one of those songs that I can't actually listen to in Renoise, without rendering it first. One more reason to save money for a new computer.",
