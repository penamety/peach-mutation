  "info": "I'm always interested in pushing classic computers to their limits.\nThis time I was given this opportunity by Paulo Simoes who programmed the Hex-Tracker 849a.\n\nThis song has been made on a pure ATARI TT, a machine released in 1990, with 4Mb of RAM, 8-bit sound quality, with 2 hardware digi-channels only.\nThe trick it - Hex gives 16 channels, using the Atari's 32Mhz Motorola CPU.\n(Can make more but with a substantial sound quality reduction).\n\nThis song is a MOD format and has all its limitations (8 bit samples, only 64Kb for a sample, only 31 samples in the module, octaves limitation) but the only difference - are those 16 channels in the MOD (software mixing).\n\nRecorded from real hardware (that originally has only 2 digi-channels, haha).\n\nEnjoy, if possible.\nYerz\n",
