  "info": "My entry for the Oldskool Music competition at Revision 2015. \nAimed for catchiness, following the \"AHX pop style\" from \"Smooth Talker\", but it also has a kind of \"untz\" factor to it (at least it did on the party speakers :)\n\nComposed pretty much in a hurry during March/April. The final touches were done on the train from Frankfurt to Saarbr√ºcken and at Revision 2015..",
