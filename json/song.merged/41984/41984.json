Credits go to:\n\nWarder, Skaven, Zirconia, Purple Motion, Jase and others (couldn't find\nany aliases or names)\n\n\nFurther greetings to: MagicMan, Tina, WGPeople, Awesome\n\n\n\nScenery:\n\nA barbarian raiding party sets foot on a snow covered island which is only\ninhabited by woodsmen and farmers. They attack the town.\nIt is an uneven battle, the townsmen are no match for the savage\nattackers. Even the town's priest is no threat for them, and he is\ndefeated soon.\nA dark figure walks calmly through the town while the battle is still\nraging.\nHe reaches for the priest's chest and takes an amulet from the dying\nbody. Then he orders his horde to burn the town and to return to the\nships.\nThe blazing fire lights up the sky even more than the dawning sun.\n\nUp on the hill, a young woodcutter cannot believe what he is seeing. The\nbodies of his people are scattered on the ground. The snow is inked in\nred, and the pirates' ships are still visible hear the horizon.\n\nThe town was not rich, so their bounty must have been small. \"Why would\nthey have attacked?\", he asks the wind.\n\nIt takes him days to bury the dead. Since there are no more hunters\npatrolling the woods, wolves already dare to come nearer over the edge of\nthe hills...\n\nSoon, the lonely woodcutter manages to repair a boat and ventures a sea\njourney.\nHe hopes to reach the continent, to find out more about the barbarian\nhorde and what they had come for if it wasn't for gold...",
