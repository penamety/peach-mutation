  "info": "This is a dubstep/chipmusic song made for the \"Weekly Treats\" series: \n[url]http://weeklytreats.net/album/29-yerzmyey-gasman[/url]\n\nHere is a video from the concert version of the song: \n[yt]feOqOBTui5g[/yt] with live drums and synths.\n\nAnyway, this song has been made on a pure ATARI TT, a machine released in 1990, with 4Mb of RAM, 8-bit sound quality, with 2 hardware digi-channels only.\nThe trick it - HexTracker gives 16 channels, using the Atari's 32Mhz Motorola CPU.\n(Can make more but with a substantial sound quality reduction).\n\nThis song is a MOD format and has all its limitations (8 bit samples, only 64Kb for a sample, only 31 samples in the module, octaves limitation) but the only difference - are those 16 channels in the MOD (software mixing).\n\nRecorded from real hardware (that originally has only 2 digi-channels, haha).",
