  "info": "Petr Koval alias 'DjHawk' wants me to write new music. And here: oila! It's name is: 'Love Unite' and it's in version 1. I made a video showing the playing MilkyTracker window but it is not syncron. But maybe it will some day. :-)\nI had to capture the sound seperately. Also it is a Beta-Version Track, indeed. o \" )\nSometimes it's a litle bit noisy and ear-damaging. - Or just not the exact, best result one would expect. Maybe more Versions to come.",
