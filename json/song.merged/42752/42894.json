  "info": "GENESIS - ILLEGAL ALIEN (8bit cover)\n\nThe original song is from 1984! Wow! Now here we are in 2016 redoing it in a souped up style that itself is emulating the late 80's/early 90's gaming technology. haha!\n\nStarted this cover sometime in the later 2000's for my housemate Keenan... Finally finished. 2016. What! Created in SchismTracker in my typical oldschool fashion :P But I did take advantage of the lowpass filter of the later versions of Impulse Tracker.\n\n~beek",
