  "info": "[i]HI ALL (?) AGAIN... A WEEK BEFORE RELEASE I DIDN'T KNOW TO BE ON THE DISK YET AS I WASN'T ON THE LIST OF IT AND DIDN'T HAVE A TUNE ANYWAY... WELL, THEN SLASH ASKED IF I DID HAVE A TUNE AND I OF COURSE SAID \"SORRY NO\" AS SO I REMEMBERED. WELL COUPLE HOURS LATER I REALISED I DO HAVE A TUNE, MEANT FOR ANOTHER PRODUCTION THAT WAS CANCELLED (FOR NOW, I WILL MAKE A NEW TUNE NEXT YEAR GUYS :D) AND USED THAT ONE. AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE STORY OF MY SIMPLE CHIP. GREETS TO ALL AND THANKS FOR THE INVOLVED FOR KEEPING AMIGA CHIPDISKS ALIVE![/i]",
