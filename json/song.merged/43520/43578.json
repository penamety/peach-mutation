  "info": "A continuation of a theme that began ten years ago: the SubEther Communique. A synth-funk /rock tune with demoscene elements. Enjoy!\n\nNo real guitarists were harmed in the recording of this song. Its a synth saw-lead sound that's run through a double-stack guitar amp simulator effect.\n\nSoundCloud link:\n[url]https://soundcloud.com/eiriksson/subether-communique-part-2[/url]",
