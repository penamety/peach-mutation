  "info": "My very first Scream Tracker song, and in fact my very first tracker song ever. In practice, a lousy rip-off of Tim Follin's Bionic Commando music on the C= 64, that continues into something else when I realized I had no idea how to copy the rest of the song. Starts and ends with a weird joke. Bionic Commando find frog. Bionic commando kill frog. Har har har, very funny. The song's name is the first word that popped in my dad's mind when he listened to it.\n\nDownload link: http://www.futurecrew.com/skaven/song_files/oldies/CASCADE.STM",
