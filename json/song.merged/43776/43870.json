  "info": "[i] When my EP is finished, check SoundCloud for this track's download link:\n[url]https://soundcloud.com/new-exodus-official/dream-crusher-part-i[/url].[/i] \n\n\"Dream Crusher\"\n[i]A poem by Nelson Addison[/i]\n[i]Written 3.30.17[/i]\n-------------------------------------------------\nCrush my dreams, why don’t you?\nThey’ll never come true anyway.\nSmell the coffee, awake to the clues:\nAspirations are a thing of yesterday.\n\nYesterday, when I was a boy.\nYou were a kid once too.\nDon't trash my dreams like broken toys;\nKill mine cause yours aren't true.\n\nDon’t throw me down into a pit,\nSubmerge my coat in blood.\nDon’t sell my heart for fifty cents,\nThen pull me from the mud.\n\nI'm destined to do great things someday.\nYou could've been a part.\nInstead you sent me on my way,\nAnd hurt my fragile heart.\n\nIf dreams can die like people do,\nThen I don't want to know.\nI'll keep believing ‘til I'm through.\nPut misery below.\n\nI'll keep on dreaming ‘til I die,\nUntil they are alive.\nI'll keep on reaching for the sky,\nAnd soon I will arrive.\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, the song title and poem are about adults, people whose dreams often didn't come true. I feel sympathy for you guys, but don't crush my dreams; there's still time for mine to come true.\n\nThis is the \"theme\" for the sci-fi book I'm writing at the moment.\n\nTrack done using Renoise 3.1.\n\nSynths used: \nSuperwave P8 (VST)\n\nLiterally the only VST instrument I used in this track. [i]Very[/i] good virtual analog synth.\n\nVST FX used: \nToo many. All the FX required for a good mix  and master (compression, EQ, multiband compression, stereo expander) and some preamp simulator FX here and there to add a bit of warmth and analog saturation.",
