  "info": "Friendly fire\nFriendly fire\nFriendly fire\n\nAll I ever hoped, all I ever asked\nWas a piece of love from you but now it is all passed\nNow I'm on my own, and I feel alone\nThat's all right as long as I remember what we've ???\nI think you believe in everything but me\nI know that you can't express the many things you see\nSo come with me, burning flames\n\nFriendly fire\nTake me higher on your friendly fire\nGive me some more of your friendly fire\nTake me higher on your friendly fire\nGive me some more of your friendly fire\n\nWhen the time has come and you're on the run\nRun away from all the things and deeds you've never done\nBut you still deny every single lie\nYou pretend that self-deception gives you wings to fly\nIt is hard to breathe when you are a thief\nAll the stolen feelings could just never heal your grief\nSo come with me, burning flames\n\nFriendly fire\nTake me higher on your friendly fire\nGive me some more of your friendly fire\nTake me higher on your friendly fire\nGive me some more of your friendly fire\n\nBig bright burning lights glittering shimmer in the night\nI believe in everything you do\nWhen the night has come, and your baby's on the run\nRealise the one and only ???\n\nFriendly fire\nTake me higher on your friendly fire\nGive me some more of your friendly fire\nTake me higher on your friendly fire\nGive me some more of your friendly fire\n\nBig bright burning lights glittering shimmer in the night\nI believe in everything you do\nWhen the night has come, and your baby's on the run\nRealise the one and only ???\nIn you\n",
