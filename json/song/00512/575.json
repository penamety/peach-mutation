  "info": "\"It all started when I got an email from someone in Japan. This person had heard some of my music and was wondering if I might be willing to arrange a song as part of an Internet-based project called \"P-MODEL Global Tribute.\" The Japanese techno-pop group P-MODEL was celebrating their 20th anniversary, and they were organizing this project to give fans around the globe (most of which were in Japan, of course) a chance to make their own versions of P-MODEL songs and write their own P-MODEL-inspired music. So I figured I'd give it a shot. I ended up being voted 1st place and having my song included in an issue of the CD-mag \"Nikkei NetN@vi\" -- very kewl ^__^\"\n\n[i]Lyrics:\n\nUNDO time, delete three minutes of the past with the specialized aircraft;\nFly on a course around the sphere that welcomes us in a million different ways.\n\nHei e, hei e,\nOne-minute mark and we see the vision;\nA crash along the winding route\nDeletes the fence around the peaceful phantoms.\n\nYumeni mita, saisei no sora, saikai no sora.\nAh--\n\nREDO fire, launch and relaunch all the missiles a thousand and one times;\nTarget the threat, fire upon the shadows that close a million passages.\n\nKabe e, kabe e,\nTwo-minute mark and an awful connection;\nWe dodge the trashy fantasy\nAnd delete the wall and its deviating task.\n\nYumeni mita, saisei no hie, saikai no hie.\nAh--\n\n[The sky of my dream]\n[The land of rebirth]\n[The day of reunion]\n[P-MODEL OR DIE]\n\nYumeni mita, saisei no hie, saikai no hie.\nAh--\n\n\"CAN DO\" brings a bombing raid upon the neuron from three minutes ago;\nBurn the flags, the flapping flags that are shutting out a million chances.\n\nHai e, hai e,\nThree minute mark and we see behind us;\nA crash deletes the drunken powers;\nI see the code reborn with \"CAN DO\"!\n\nYumeni mita, saisei no chie, saikai no chie.\nAh--[/i]",
