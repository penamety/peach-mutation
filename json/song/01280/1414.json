  "info": "So many things till the end of summer 97. It was official, i’ve succeed the admission exams to be Sound Ingineer at the I.A.D. I’ve left Seraing to settle in the univerCITY of Louvain La Neuve with my new friend Didier Rombauts. So i should find quickly a computer and have bought the one of my friend Cédric Vanrutten, a Cyrix 166mhz with a problematic Aztec Sound Galaxy II that won’t work first correctly with Windows 95 and Impulse Tracker… During the first days i should choose between 16bits or stereo… Finally it’s over !\nSo i’ve wrote this song, with a great melody something inspirated from ERA – Ameno and the belgian artist Luc Baiwir.\nAt that time it was just a clin d’oeil, but the title : Back to the monaster is a reference to the song Falling in love (monaster mix)… Yes, i was back tot the Saint Roch monaster….\n\nproject : Esperenza\nproject download : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/11973",
