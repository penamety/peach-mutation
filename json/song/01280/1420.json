  "info": "My friends Hunter left me alone in Louvain-La-Neuve, so i worked hard on new musical projets with my Roland keyboard. I was probably inspirated from Van-Halen – Jump that i worked in my pop band Virtual Music during i’m working on this new track.\n\nWith the help of the integrated basic sequencer of my Roland, i would be able to record in MIDI format the actual project i’ve found on my keyboard to work on it later with Impulse Tracker.\n\nIn a Virtual life was born and the track still now could be spotted out of the large number of tracks i’ve written. As if right now, it may be sound too much as a MIDI file due to the use of samples from my Roland and the Casio keyboard of my friend Vivien Vanoirbeek.\n\nDuring long years that song was used by the G.R.S. club « La Salamandre » from Seraing where my sister Marie was member.",
