  "info": "Sure, tracks as [song]1436[/song], realised with Pype and Tbob under the label name The Dream Team was excellent and I realy want to do more, but up in my Kot in LLN, I didn’t have any guitar sounds. So I’ve first worked on this song inspirated from a module called TAKE.XM from Floppy, found in a PC TEAM or PC FUN magazine. Result just sound Rave music maybe with some EMAX/TRSI inspiration… But i had the idea with the sound effect of my brother Pype to vocalise something sounding like a metal guitare, and here is the Power Mix version !\n\nProject name : Esperenza",
