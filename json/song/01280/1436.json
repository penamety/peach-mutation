  "info": "Cyborg Jeff, DJ Rodrigues and Codasm, together in a new band named : Dream Team are proud you to present : Everybody need house. Our first tune was realised like this : Basic theme and jungle drum by DJ Rodriguez, Hard drive chorus guitar played by Codasm and arrangement and vocal by Cyborg Jeff.\n\nOkay Dudes, open your ears, shut up and listen to this mod who have mixed by Cyborg Jeff, the only one !\n\nAll guitar samples from the Fender Mustang and Super Chorus out of the dusty ampli of Codasm.\n\nI have a lot of problem to work cause memory were bugging all the time. Yes, the first IT written by Tbob in may 97 sized only 40ko but this one now probably approache of 4mo. But it seems to work, i donâ€™t realy know with my Pentium will be able to reload it as at the last saved, it just let me 5ko of free memory !\n\nproject : Esperenza\nproject download : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/11973",
