  "info": "You came from heaven, sent to fill me up with joy.\nMy expectations rose as I played with my new toy.\nThe music was stomping; my heart was pumping, ready to explode.\nWas it real or was it a dream? I could not really tell.\nNow those days are gone, but the memory remains of you.\n\nThe ultimate game machine, the ultimate waste of time.\nSitting there for hours and hours: you became my life.\nOvernight, a score: C64.\n\nAs I said, those days are gone. They won't be back for very long,\nBut when I fire you up again, I still feel full,\nFull of energy that lies within this lump of plastic box\nAnd the memory of old high scores and battles with my bro.\n\nAnother visitor! Stay a while. Stay forever!\nI-Ball! Game over!\n\nBut then Amiga came and stole my heart from you.\nI hope you will forgive me: I and you forever true.\n\nThe ultimate game machine, the ultimate waste of time.\nSitting there for hours and hours: the computer that was my life, C64.\n",
