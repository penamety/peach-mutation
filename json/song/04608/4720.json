  "info": "From the music disk \"blur plastiq\", ftp://ftp.scene.org/mirrors/hornet/music/disks/1996/fm-plast.zip.  Notes from Mellow-D:\n\n        Very much rougher than the rest of the stuff.  I actually\n        turn down the amplification in FT2 because this is a bit\n        overdriven :). More filters in the leads.\n\n        Heh, do you hear that panning feedback thing?  Me and Mig\n        made that by plugging a mic into my effects processor,\n        plugging that into his set of analog effects, and going\n        (just once) \"ha\" into the microphone. No kidding. Wow.\n\n        This song has basically let off a lot of steam I had at\n        the time.\n",
