  "info": "From the music disk \"blur plastiq\", ftp://ftp.scene.org/mirrors/hornet/music/disks/1996/fm-plast.zip.  Notes from Mellow-D:\n\n        See yourself as an angel.  This was done when I was\n        still living in Brussels (I live in Finland again now).\n        We went to see Seven with a bunch of friends, and when I\n        got back home I started to track.  What a fantastic movie\n        and what an inspiration!\n\n        The sound is intentionally as it is.  The sound actually\n        reminds me of a VERY dusty room with the walls in very\n        bad shape, and everything has turned yellow from all the\n        cigarette and other smoke.\n\n        Made in summer 96, this song was also greatly inspired\n        by Front 242.  The vocals aren't me again, they've been\n        sampled in a random sampling session, FROM THE RADIO :)\n        I got lucky.\n",
