  "info": "Lyrics (by Kim Ault):\nIf I could gather all the stars and hold them in my hand,\nthe colors I would then possess would not be half as grand\nas those which I have seen when I look deep into your eyes,\nor come across when I have kissed your lips, I realize.\n\nIf I could ponder all the truths men sought since time began,\nthey would not teach me more than if I were to touch your hand\nFor truth to no one you have touched appears as simple lies\nAnd nothing could be truer than your touch, I realize.\n\nIf I were given lasting life as only God could do,\nI'd shun it all and turn away, if I could live with you.\nFor even God has never known the immesurable size\nOf the love that is within your heart, I realize.",
