  "info": "1st in PC Demo compo at ReAct 2002\n---\n\"In fact it’s the first tune I’ve ever made for an ASD demo in 2002, after which I officially joined ASD. The demo in question is called Edge of Forever . The tune has several snippets from the movie Contact with Jodie Foster which is among my most favorite movies of all time and it’s my little tribute to the movie and Carl Sagan.\n\nYes people… We are not alone!\"\n\n[url]http://www.amusic.gr/we-are-not-alone/[/url]",
