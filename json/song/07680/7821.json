(x2)\nWe just need to recognize it to find our way, which leads to satisfaction. (x2)\n\nHow could we easily find back to our way?\nWith all this bullshit-television and radiocasts.\nThey are poison!\nThey want to tell us how we should live our lives,\nand how everything else should be.\nThey are poison!\n\nKeep away this bullshit and go your way,\neven when you don't know which direction you should choose,\njust go...\nAnd you will find, what you were searching for.\nIt's perhaps not exactly what you wanted, but\nit will lead you on to the right way.\n\nLife - go, just go (x4)\n\nLife...",
