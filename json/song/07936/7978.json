  "info": "1st song Times of Lore (#1) / M. Galway\n2nd song Deel 3 / J. Tel\n3rd song Cybernoid 2 (#1) / J. Tel\n\nI can still hear my mother yell, \"Son! Time for bed!\" -- and I'd put my pyjamas on, brush my teeth, and go to bed. But then I'd hear something in the dark: I would hear my computer talking to me. It would say, \"Come on, dude! Just one more mission. Just one more level.\" And I just had to get up, and do what I must...\n\nYou search the taste of steel as you watch them burn and die.\nSlaying your virtual foe, you leave them where they lie.\nIt's easy to be mean when death equals a high score screen\nAnd hell on earth spells game over.\n\nNo time for innocence when death comes swift and cold.\nBerserk in the night, blood is your goal.\nIt's easy to be mean when death equals a high score screen\nAnd hell on earth spells game over.\n\nYou can take your Quake and go away:\nI won't play it anyway.\nIK+, Bubble Bobble, Ranarama beats it by far.\nThe graphics might be blocky, but so what?\n\nThe feeling is bad, music is rad:\nNot much more to ask for or say.\nThe games of my childhood will stay.\n",
