What the f*ck is this?\nI guess it's time to tweak my config.sys\n\nFiles says 80 and buffers says 10\nGot that Quarterdeck b**ch all up in my RAM\n486DX to the 4\nRun everything smoothly, on just one core\n\n320x200, 256 colors\nRun PCB, Amiga, they make me holler\n\nFrom plasma fires, to torus blobs\nPolygonal orgies that just don't stop\nGouraud shaded donuts, lowres as fuck\ncopperbars and shit, bobs already sucked\n\nWe did on Amiga what we faked on PCs\nIn those times, the Commodores grew on trees\nLife was still merry, everything was still fun\nI rendered 99 polys and I shaded none\n\nFellow Meeting (i was there)\nAssembly '92 (i was there)\nThe Party '94 (i was there)\nGathering '96 (i was there)\nMekka '98 (i was there)\nBizarre 2000 (i was there)\nEvoke 2002 (i was there)\nBreakpoint 2k7 (we are here!)\n\nLet me take you back to '95\nwhen the Demoscene was still alive\nA high tower, floppy drive, and a CRT\nwas all I needed for a scener to be x2\n\nTime for the shoutouts to my crazy homies from the old days\nNoon, my homies at Triton, Future Crew, Halcyon, Logic Design, Dutch homies\nAcme, my homies at Candela\nStraight up all of you. To the olden days\nPouring one out for the fallen and locked up.\nYou're all in my heart homeboys\nKeep it realtime!\n\nOoh, baby move ax to b\nI got my pixel shaders ready so can't you see\nNo guts, no glory when you're playing MODs\nAnd check your BBSs for the latest prods\nLet me take you back to '95\nwhen the Demoscene was still alive\nA high tower, floppy drive, and a CRT\nwas all I needed for a scener to be x2\n\nLet me take you back to '95\nwhen the Demoscene was still alive\nA high tower, floppy drive, and a CRT\nwas all I needed for a scener to be x2",
