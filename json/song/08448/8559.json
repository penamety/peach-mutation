  "info": "I made this for a remix contest being held by Divinorum ([artist]378[/artist]), composer of the original piece. He placed all the entries on his MP3 page while the contest was going, and once the submission deadline passed he announced the winner and took down all but the top 10. Unfortunately, I procrastinated and didn't get the piece done until the very last minute (it shows, IMHO), and I didn't make it into the top 10, so my remix wasn't displayed on the site for more than a couple hours. That was a bit of a bummer, but certainly a lesson for the future. And I did have the honor of being one of the few entrants who submitted a tracked tune :-)",
