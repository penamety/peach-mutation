Straight from the top of my dome\nas I rock rock rock, rock the microphone!\n\nWe are beyond the time of correction,\nA rebuild now could only follow destruction\nThe system cannot be reformed,\nthe structure will never transform by itself\n\nYeah! Straight from the top of my dome\nas I rock rock rock, rock the microphone!",
