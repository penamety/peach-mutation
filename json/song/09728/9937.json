Music-man!\n\nHere we go again! The time has come for more!\nOnce again we ramble on about that everything was better before!\nPlaying Monty on my Commodore!\nWhen the games were in their prime!\nLet me take you back in time! x2\n\nHey listen!\n\nIn '94 came the psONE!\nOnce again an epic journey in my time begun!\nGaming every day in the atmosphere of Metal Gear\nand Silent Hill was absolute..... FEAR!\n\nThe next year came the N64,\nthey just don't make'em like those on it any more!\nLegendary games out of Tokyo - like Mario\nand every other hero should shrink... Compared to Link!\n\nHere we go again! The time has come for more!\nOnce again we ramble on about that everything was better before!\nPlaying Monty on my Commodore!\nWhen the games were in their prime!\nLet me take you back in time! x2 ",
