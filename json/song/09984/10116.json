  "info": "Note the VIC chip of the Commodore 64 not the SID is used to produce the sound of this one.\n\n\nEdit of Elrinth: There's a really annoying sound going thru the whole song suggesting there is something wrong with it.. It's actually meant to be this way, but I'm sorry I can't approve it for weekly listening.\n\nIf you want to listen to it, just download the song yourself.",
