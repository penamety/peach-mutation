  "info": "Sometimes I just want to be in a kitchen;\nA small room, where there is nobody but food;\nTime, and a chance to taste about every meal in my life.\n\nBut then, there would be strong will inside of me,\nwhich fights but could not get out;\nbecause everything would go out that way.\nIf I'd want it or not.\n\nBut I can lead my stomach in the right direction,\nwhen I make use of these forks and spoons,\nand just eat...\n\nThere are many calories in every meat, in every pie, every beer.\nWe just need to recognize it and take our weight,\nwhich leads to fascination.\n\nHow could we easily get back our shape!\nWith all these Bullshit-fat-reduced and diet- sodas?\nThey are poison!\nThey want to tell us we shouldn't keep our extra pounds,\nand how slim we should stay.\n\nKeep away this bullshit and gain some weight,\neven if you don't know which dessert you will choose,\njust eat...\nAnd you will find, what you were searching for.\nIt is in fact not at all what you wanted, but\nit will lead you onto the fat way.\n\nFood -\neat, just eat",
