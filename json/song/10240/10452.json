  "info": "After many, many months in production, Necrolatry II is finally released. It is now packed with 18 channels of sounds and effects in Triton's Fast Tracker II's XM format. It supercedes Necrolatry, earlier released with Necrolatry (The demo) back in 1994. Necrolatry was 4 tracks then.\n\nNecrolatry II is now more upbeat and exciting. It incooperates many special sound effects like Dobly(R) Pro Logic Surround (with encoded samples), Virtual Surround, and many more. It also contains crystal-clear, 16-bits samples, sampled from the state-of-the-art Roland XP-80.\n\nHear the cymbal brushes through your face! And hears the drums dance from front to rear! \n\nThis piece of music is best heard on a Dobly Pro Logic Surround compatible amplifier/decoder.",
