  "info": "Darkness and tranquility dominates the hours of pre-dawn, until the first ray of light, the first dim glow, would come, and melt a hole in the afar.\nThe sun then softly rises, gently knocking on your dreams, bringing with it the fire of life and the whisper of hopes.\nIt's a brand new day, with much to accomplish.\nIt's everyone's turn to give, in any way.\nEven knowing that somebody else breath easier because you live, is a valuable accomplishment.",
