  "info": "I took a pause for some months. Then I got pestered by our inofficial team leader (Hi Phil) to write a new demo and a song for a copy party. The demo was compiled out of some routines I had in stock - the songs starts out original then fades into a tribute to “All she wants is” from “Duran Duran”. Also featuring one of the characteristic LPA attributes: playing melodies with metallic noise samples :-)",
