  "info": "Music & Vocals: Spiral\nLyrics: MÃ¥ns Lindman (a friend of mine)\nMade with: Reason in the year 2005\n\n[Bioplastic - A Different Man]\n\nLyrics:\n\nBehind the mirror lies a different man.\nHe hides from the others, the ones who are not like him.\nIn his mind there's always a liquid thought. He wants to be someone.\n\nSomeone meant to be seen, someone wants to be clean. But in his eyes everything's black.\nBlack like the sea at night. Noone will see what lies beneath.\nLook at me why can't you see... \nSee me?\nWhy can't you all be like me?\n\nDwelled in shadows lies a broken man.\nStalking the streets at night, avoiding the ones who are not like him.\nIn his mind there's always a dangerous thought. He wants to be someone.\n\nSomeone meant to be seen, someone wants to be clean. But in his eyes everything's black.\nBlack like the sea at night. Noone will see what lies beneath.\nLook at me why can't you see... \nSee me?\nWhy can't you all be like me?\n\nIn this room lies a convicted man.\nLaughing at the others, that are not... like him. \nIn his mind there was always one last thought. He needed to be someone.\n\nAnother shiny blade through the night.\nAnother throat cut without remorse.\nAnother body counted for. \n\nSomeone meant to be seen, someone wants to be clean. But in his eyes everything's black.\nBlack like the sea at night. Noone will see what lies beneath.\nLook at me why can't you see... \nSee me?\nWhy can't you all be like me?",
