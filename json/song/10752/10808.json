  "info": "Solo Mechanism (23/06/94) Copyright (c) 1994 by Chuck Biscuits (iCE/DiE/HTC)\n\nThe name really says it all with this song. It's just a vehicle for a solo. Before, i was really dissed about this tune,  but the final result is not too bad, as it turns out.\nQuick greets go to: necros, mellow-d, cybelius, maelcum, obaid/diablo, ryan cramer (thanks for the fantastic pad samples you did for us!), nemesis, black artist, and all the people i forgot, as i can not honestly remember any one's name today :). A special greet goes out to all those who appreciate blues/rock guitar music, of the real, humbucked but not overclipped, sound.\n",
