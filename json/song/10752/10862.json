  "info": "Long song is long. The extreme duration of this song was not intentional, but hence it was one of the first ones I made, it got this disadvantage. I plan on remixing this one into something more \"compact\". Until then, this is the full one.\n\nBanned for the following reasons: song too long for what it is, song got low votes, song got complaining in the oneliner, song got complaints in the comments, and the artist suggests it's a learning tune.  We suggest considering a hypothetical compact version enabled if and when it's uploaded instead of this one. --- sqrmax",
