  "info": "This one originated just like an experiment with the Bloody Machine song. I wanted the chorus high\ntones to last longer, so I was playing with looping the sample. After some coincidental\nshortening of the forward loop lenght, it sounded normally and then looped like a chiptune,\nwhich I quite liked. In this track are also the ideas that didn't make it to the first song, namely the shouting vocal thing and reversed drum beat.",
