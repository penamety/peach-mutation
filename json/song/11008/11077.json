  "info": "basehead/fm/kosmic\nhey kids... hope you enjoy this houz/tranz/breakbeat or whatever you want to call it track... =) i spent quite a bit of time on it and perharps i got carried away so sorry if it all doesn't go completely together... well like i said, enjoy it...\nthis track is for the musicdisk with stalker/fm and myself... i wanted to throw in something harder to show everyone that i'm not all mellow and jazzy all the time =)\nthanx to necros, because he sent me like a 5 pattern song on which this entire track based... plus he gave me a bunch of the samples...\nother samples are from \"open your mind\" by 3Phase (cd), and also from Dr;Alban's \"it's my life (euromix)\" (cd), pitty/dytec's \"longing for techno 2\" mod, dune/orange's tune from the x-y-z demo, and last but not least... \"sax it up\" by saxmachine (cd)...\n\nwerdwerdwerdwerdwerdwerd...\n\npeace-out!\n\n-bh-june 26-1995- -btw, this song has NO resemblence to 3phase's \"open your mind\" ar all, except for the vocal.-\n",
