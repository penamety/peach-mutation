  "info": "This is *NOT* AY! I used this category only because there's no corner for Spectrum's Z80 chip sound. \n\nZX Spectrum 48K chiptune (Z80 chip). \n\nThis is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer. \n\nThis editor (Orfeus) makes from original hardware one channel of square wave without any volume control -  3 channels, in a way of software mixing, adding envelopes and simulating volume's changes.\n\nHowever, like they wrote on 8BC, this is a tune for TWO beepers - for two synchronized Spectrums48. :) \n\nWhich gives 6 channels.
