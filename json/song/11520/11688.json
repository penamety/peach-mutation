  "info": "Winner of the streamed music compo @ Compusphere 2007.\n\n\nI lie awake, watching the heavens\nPretty soon, it might be too late\nFeeling victimised, burning like vengeance\nAll this waiting is trying my faith\n\nWhen all of this is over\nYou'll still live on\nThrough the void eternal\nEchoes of your song\n\nAnd while stars are dying\nYour rain comes through\nTo stop the fire burning\nWhen everything is new\n\nCHORUS:\nI want to soar [along? alone on?] your horizon\nDrifting through your everlasting night\nTest my faith for you that I believe in\nFor an infinite eternity in time\n\nFrozen in time on the verge of escaping\nCircling indefinitely, resting in peace\nMatter colliding, sustaining no motion\nCutting the heartbeat, all movement will cease\n\nWhen all of this is over\nAnd only you remain\n'Cross the distant spaces\nMay I run once again\n\nAnd while stars are dying\nYour rain comes through\nTo stop the fire burning\nAnd everything is new\n\n(repeat CHORUS x 2)\n",
