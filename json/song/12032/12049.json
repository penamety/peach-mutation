  "info": "Track #2 of Variform Remixed.\n\nHere I am, Alkama, happy to share this humble remix of a fucking great tune! I know this variation can feel strange compared to the original feeling. I did it as it came. Hope you wont get mad at its repetitive theme, I'm more into ambiance than into variations these days. I also got the \"early preview\" and \"unfinished\" disease which makes me unable to maintain a sufficient interest into what I'm doing for a long time. Guess that explains why I'm more into collaboration and coproductions than solo projects. Anyway, brothers of the north, brothers of the south, I wish you all the best. Take good care of you all. And lets share a beer next time we meet! .. .. Special hugz to the calodox family members, the tpolm gang, and for all the great mfx/kewlers community. You guys are important to me. And wet kisses for the halcyon, blasphemy, $ystem, replay, and kosmoplovci crews. Hi to the wet lapinou. And thank YOU, dear listener, who had the courage to read all my shit till the end;) Next time we meet, aks me to give you the coconut cake recipe, you wont be disappointed! .. .. .. .. This scroller will now repeat .. ",
