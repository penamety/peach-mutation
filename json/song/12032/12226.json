Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.\n\nAuthor's note: \"8 channels song, only tones, no drums. The 3,5Mhz CPU was working to death while playing this tune. ;)\nThis time I used software: ZX-7 Polyphonic Musical Instrument, Virtual Synthesiser and some stolen routine in machine code. Everything on Timex 48Kb.\"\n\nhttp://mister_beep.republika.pl/music.html",
