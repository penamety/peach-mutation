  "info": "(February 2006)\n\nThis is *NOT* AY!\nThis is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.\n\nAuthor's note: \"3 channels (including drums). This time I used again Orfeus Music Assembler and also made a small routine in BASIC (with BEEP commands). As Orfeus has some envelopes (not editable â€˜though) I made attempt to do a delay effect in 1-bit music. Sounds pretty cool. \"\n\nhttp://mister_beep.republika.pl/music.html\n\n\n\n",
