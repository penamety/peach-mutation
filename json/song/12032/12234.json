Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.\n\nAuthor's note: \"This song has been inspired by famous ZX Spectrum game's music: \"AnoGaia\" by Andy Mills. It's title is: \"File Not Found\". :) For intro I used ALBERT EINSTEIN DRUMS (one-bit drum-machine) and for main part of music I used 3-Channel Synthesiser.\"\n\nhttp://mister_beep.republika.pl/music.html",
