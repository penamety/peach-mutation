  "info": "(MAY / JUNE 2006)\n\nThis is *NOT* AY!\nThis is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.\n\nAuthor's note: \"This time I used Drum Machine (a 1-bit and 1-channel program that is able to generate various drum-like noices and put them into its on-board sequencer) and The Music Studio to make main part of the music. Once again I made some experiments with delay and I surmounted one bit limitations again - the cool delay works. ;) Enjoy the song!\"\n\nhttp://mister_beep.republika.pl/music.html",
