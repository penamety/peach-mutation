  "info": "Song format is Hippel, Amiga. However: \"As far I know there is no generic Hippel COSO player that plays level songs from Wings of Death well. Hence I decided to make a custom version, ripping the playroutine from the game. The playroutine used in W.O.D clearly differs from many HIPC players.\" (taken from [url=http://www.exotica.org.uk/wiki/Wings_of_Death]unexotica[/url]).\n\n[url=http://www.antialias.se/chiptunes/hip/]download .hip (cus :-)[/url]",
