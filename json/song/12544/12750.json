Hence I decided to make a custom version, ripping the playroutine from the game. The playroutine used in W.O.D clearly differs from many HIPC players.\" (quoted from [url=http://www.exotica.org.uk/wiki/Wings_of_Death]unexotica[/url]).\n\n[url=http://www.antialias.se/chiptunes/hip/]download .hip (cus :-)[/url]",
