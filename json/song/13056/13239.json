  "info": "An oppressive track which sounds like a marching army and destroying everything in its path and that we can not stop. It all began with the sample 'String Meg' and this feeling of chaos and power. The tune was built slowly because I didn't have a clear idea of development. But I wanted to have a very calm and soothing moment in the middle and then to continue with violence. March of time was the perfect way to describe this module. Comments are welcomed. ",
