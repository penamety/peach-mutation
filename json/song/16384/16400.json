In this new song, I once again mixed piano’s melody as in Robert Miles songs with here a second voices using an electronic instrument close to the Adlib FM sounds of the Yamaha OPL3 that we could hear in the MS-DOS PC version of the game Nicky Boom…. Some sounds was also sampled out of Waxattack and Ice Mc titles.\nThis flying melodies, i re-try to work on it many times. The best version was an update of this one in 1997 that you could hear in the anniversary album « We Want More« .\nA war witout weapons…. with only musical notes….\n\nproject : Planer n'est pas jouer\nproject download : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/22103\nyoutube : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxJPkg0-5E",
