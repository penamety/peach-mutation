  "info": "Just dream… the Crazy Brix project began to be kwel… We could play it, it’s still often crashed, but my brother Pype have succeed to add my soundtrack modules in the game… So i was imagined we could have an animated intro with a Dance Track in the mood of 2 Unlimited but including oldschool C64 sounds…. Something realy ambitious for Breakout like game.\n\nHit the bricks was born… counting once again the adventures of Jack Boost in a new kind of spaceship !\n\nRef :\n\nYou must burn,\nYou must run,\nHit the bricks, hit hit hit the bricks\n\nCoup :\n\nYou have been chosen,\n‘cause you are the best,\n‘cause you could pass this mission\n\nYou have been chosen,\nYou must save the earth,\nYou must shoot this fiction\n\nPont :\n\nNo question, only the best weapons\nYou must hit the bricks or we gonna sick\nThrow your ball and shoot them all\nIf you heard a tick, you have hitten a brick \n\nProject : Crazy Brix, Summer Island\nProject Download : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/9629",
