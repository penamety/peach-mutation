  "info": "Just wait … and there is a more intersting production… Back to Dream music and its quiet piano’s melodies, mixed with techno sounds and beat… And well, i should admit there was a link to the song Classic of House, cause i’ve tried to add again some classical instrument… sounding better in this track.\n\nA special hello to Alain Rinallo, sound producer, that i’ve met with my friend Vivien. I’ll visit his sound’s studio for the first time… and then dreaming to produce a Cyborg Jeff’s album… and have the same work !",
