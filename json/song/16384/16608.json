  "info": "Codasm : « I Really lOve this tune because of the feeling it gives, Well done, CJ ! »\n\nDuring i went to the cinema watching to Roméo + Juliette with T-Bob, Doudou and ;QRIE, my bros Pype listened in loop to my new flying track…\n\nWith this Space is my Reality i started new melodic trance style inspirated from my mentor Pierrick Hansen and his Space Project, witch the 2nd essai’s samples helped me a lot !\n\nStrangely, with a confirmated potential, i forgot to add the song to my next CD Album « Summer Island » released in summer 97. Space is my Reality only appeared in Esperenza in january 98.\n\nSome years later, in 2002, working on the project Pixelization, i decided to rework it as a gift to my brother who likes so much that theme !\n\nProject : Esperenza\nProject download : http://www.jamendo.com/fr/album/11973\n\n----------\nFor some reason, CyborgJeff added the tags \"Pierrick Hansen\" to this song.  ???...",
