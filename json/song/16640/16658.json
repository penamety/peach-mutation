  "info": "Till i’ve starting making Sound Tracker music, the creations of my friend Pierrick Hansen had deep impact on my own productions. I often listen to it and was inspirated by technic, ideas, melodies or sounds that he had made during his insomniak nights on Fast Tracker.\n\nIn february 98, i was inspirated from this project SPACE #17. With some new arrangement i should finished an ehance this track. Using my new Roland, Casio and Future Music Magasine samples i will prove to the world the power of Vega !\n\nOne of the important thing i would like to find i this so specific sounds from DJ Sash!. Mixing one of the instrument of Pierrick and a Pizzicato from my Roland Keyboard i was close to that !\n\nThis track will be the lead one from my last K7 album « Use my keyboard to make an Earthquake« , the last one played in the IAD. Finaly « Vega is a Paradise » will be included in the CD album Eyes Dreams.",
