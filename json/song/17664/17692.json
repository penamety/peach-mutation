  "info": "In a demo by Edwin van Santen, which he released about two years after Coco Intro was made popular in the Papillion's crack intro, he claims that he in fact composed the music. This demo contained a new version of the tune (this sid). He explains how he had made the music two years earlier on some composer like Soundmonitor or something similar. While at a copyparty, someone supposedly stole his music disk which had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the tune. bout two months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions' intro and no credit was given to van Santen. See Mueller_Markus - Coco_Intro.sid for more details.\n\nTune is sort of cover of \"You keep me hanging on\" originally written by Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier in 1966",
