  "info": "Greetings to all the little spirits that were there and told me what knobs to tweak... So, as I went through the pinhole, all i could see was hazy colors and patterns. It was obvious that I needed to focus for the battle in the dawn. It was yet far, but everpresent. Bellowing inside the monster my mind was bending in directions I was too scared to follow. After the drums they rushed from all directions, screaming mindlessly as they headed towards the red glow in the horizon. Sharp edges appeared, jagged ruins in the frozen landscape, crumbled under their weight. No more buzzing and blinking, all gone. And the shadows grew. Dead icy grass rotting away, footprints showing the way. Days to weeks and stop. Now they could cease and surrender. Happy. Smiles, no tears, they become one with the land, as others headed their way, following the path set by hundreds before them. .. .. .. .. This scroller will now repeat .. .. .. ..",
