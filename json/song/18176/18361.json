  "info": "Frequent (sorryform)\n\nFrequent on the keys again, typing a bit about the second tune. As with the first one, it's made with reason, but are based around the samples from the greetings part in the variform demo. When relaxing at the boozembly 2004, and idea of making another remix came to my mind. I told Little Bitchard about a second remix, and got the green light for doing it.. . . .. This tune is a very moody one, without any kind of drums or beats, but I think it worked out very well, when listening to the final result..... Anyway, i'm a bit out of ideas right now, and tired after a long and hard day at work, so I just leave it here and sign off... .. .. .. This scroller will now repeat .. .. .. ..",
