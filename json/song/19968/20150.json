  "info": "Why is it that the sadness wouldn't leave,\nThat there's always something cold in this warm world of mine?\nEvery sun ray seems to hurt; flowers fade as I walk by.\nThis small itch when I think everything's just fine.\n\nSo why don't I feel the contentment, the happiness I am supposed to feel?\nWhy do I still dwell in compassion, denying to see that my dream's come real?\nI just want to finally realise I'm in control of what I'll become,\nWithout need of asking the world while still here and not long gone.\n\nCome on!\n",
