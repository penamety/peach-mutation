  "info": "\"Made to The Gathering 1994 music-compo, ended up on a 12th spot. The song was built up mainly on samples from my (at the time) newly acquired Roland U20 synth, as well shows improved use of my Boss DR660 drum machine. When listening to it now 14 years later, I find the overall sound quality rather nice (consider my gear and possibilities back in 1994), but the composition being very tied up by the 4 channel limitations. I should have done it in a PC XM format instead. Maybe I'll remix it to a new MP3 version someday. :) I also coded a small music-presenter for this song with a picture of a jungle and a bridge over a big cliff and a old-school scroller full of bullocks. Anyone seen that production? :D\"",
