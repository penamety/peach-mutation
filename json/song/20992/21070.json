  "info": "Remix of the Jesus On E's soundtrack by Echo. Lyrics:\n\nOoh yeah! C'mon!\n\nMy warped senses tell me\nThat nothing I see is real.\nSaturday tends to betray me\nLike a (??? suggester), you see.\nThe time to wonder ceases:\nYou'll (??? solely) see\nThat your religion's based on\nNothing but Jesus on E's.\n\nSlam the door when you're leaving,\nSo I'll know for sure that you're gone.\n??? (will try to compel?)\n??? force is set free.\n\nReality's razors will teach you\nThat Satan is high on speed,\nAnd LSD will convince thee\nThat Jesus was whacked on E's!\n",
