  "info": "From the music disk \"blur plastiq\", ftp://ftp.scene.org/mirrors/hornet/music/disks/1996/fm-plast.zip.  Notes from Mellow-D:\n\n        My good friend Tero Kokko (zapster) brought over some CD's\n        one day for me to sample, which is where I got most of the\n        loops from.  The \"fade away\" sample is from the AWESOME\n        Apollo 440 song Liquid Cool. The man shouting is not me,\n        it's someone from can't-remember-where.\n\n        There's always a constant beat in the background, panned\n        to somewhere so that it's not in the foreground when it\n        isn't supposed to be.  The filtered samples (not 303)\n        are from miscellaneous synths that I've borrowed or had,\n        for example the Wavestation A/D.\n\n        No personal feelings or such here, I had just been jonesing\n        for a groove.  I like the way the bass and the filters\n        talk to each other, along with that one (the short) pad.\n\n        Ooh. Me didgeridoo. Them filters. Near the end.\n",
