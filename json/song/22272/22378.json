  "info": "Nothing special to say here but let's babble something... My original intention was to make an accurate 4 channel chip conversion of Variform soundtrack but as it turned out to be a bit too ambitious project at the time I decided to try something different with some chip-flavour so to say. Tracking was done with Impulse Tracker using some original sequences from the soundtrack and some old 8-bit chiptune samples. At the moment, well over a year since this song was made, I'm still quite happy with it's basic idea although it could have been a lot better. Well, too late for regrets now. Greetings to Mfx, Kewlers, Phn. and all the others I know from past... .. .. .. This scroller will now repeat .. .. .. ..",
