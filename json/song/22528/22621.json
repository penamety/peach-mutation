But why did I call it \"My Endless Silkroad\"?\nInspiration came from the Silkroad.. If you don't know what I mean by this, then just contact me :)\n\nMy Greetings and respect goes to:\nTassy, Larsec, Markus Schneider, Thomas Detert, Infamous, O2, Sidologie, Slaygon, Curlin, Kwed, Jihad and all in HiTMEN.\"",
