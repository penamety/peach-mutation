  "info": "\"The theme melody for this one was originally slightly different. I changed it when I realised I'd stolen it from the Jamiroquai song 'Destitute Illusions' :) Initially the drumset was also weaker, I think the final drum sounds were provided by Tempest. Oh, and for the dumb title: it's 118bpm, 64kb, and... hang on, I've actually forgot what 194 stood for. Oh well.\"\n\nRanked 5th in the 64kB music compo at Different Life 2001 held from to 1st March, 2002.",
