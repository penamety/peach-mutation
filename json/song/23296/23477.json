  "info": "\"I actually like this one. I paid more attention to sound quality and mixing than I usually do in modules, and I think it turned out quite alright. The last two parts are unnecessary, could've just ended the tune before them. The \"beat is working\" vocals are from some terrible a cappella rap that I found on the web. Oh, and I just remembered, at the time I was trying to capture a specific setting or landscape in my tunes - while tracking this one I thought of the words \"enchanted forest\". I suppose I thought of it less when I added the rap though :)\"\n\nRanked 2nd in the tracked music compo at Breakpoint 2005 held in Rundsporthalle, Bingen am Rhein, Germany from 25th to 28th March, 2005.",
