  "info": "\"I started to compose Journey to Bali on my Korg MicroX. I started with a bells preset and wrote a 30-second loop. Then I just left it at that and made some other 30-second songs. My girlfriend really liked 'Journey to Bali' and she asked me if I could finish it for her mp3 player. So actually there was no way not to finish it, she is much stronger than me :) The final version was not made on the MicroX because I had to sell it. So you don't hear those bells :( I'm very sad because they sound much better than this plastic guitar like instrument now. For the final version I used: Roland Juno-G (piano, clarinet, guitar and harph), Atmosphere (strings), Trilogy (bass), Session drummer 2 (guess what ;) and one loop in the background. For sequencing I use an ableton live 5. All of instruments are played by myself and are not quantized :)\" -Siatek\n\n[ from: http://www.hugi.scene.org/online/hugi34/hugi%2034%20-%20editorial%20magic%20hugi%2034%20-%20behind%20the%20music.htm ]",
