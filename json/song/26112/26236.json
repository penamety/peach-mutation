[...] It appears on\n         Synth Sample as interpreted by a friend of mine. I didn't know what it\n         was myself until I happened to see Stationary Ark one time. This song\n         does not play properly on some C-64's where the SID chip filter is\n         calibrated differently.\" (GF)",
