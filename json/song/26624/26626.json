  "info": "1st place in pc demo compo at Evoke 2009\n\nLyrics:\nBefore I can catch you, you're slipping my grip\nIn plain sight you vanish mysterious creep\nGreen, blue and yellow like a rainbow strip\nYou're changing a million colors\n\nFamiliar allure, there is nothing to see\nA play of the senses you put on for me\nTo have and to hold is to lose and regret\nYou're making this all too easy\n\nI come to your nightmares, you come to my dreams\nIt feels like it's heaven made out of our sins\nAs coal turns to diamond undone come the seams\nI'm tangled in this confusion\n\nCome too close\nThen run away\nDon't know who's hiding\nIf I am just finding\nThis treacherous nasty\nChameleon behaviour of yours\n\nI've learned to interpret your playful intent\nBut still you surprise me, and you don't relent\nI think of escaping and then I repent\nYou're turning into addiction\n\nThe reasons are something you keep to yourself\nAnd all of our moments I keep on a shelf\nAs I step on forward you take two steps back\nAnd back as I go.. you follow\n\nCome too close\nAnd stay some more\nFeeling I'm hunted\nAnd taking for granted\nThis perverted shifty\nChameleon behaviour of yours\n\nAdmitting my feelings again is so quaint\nLike all of those colours you won't let me paint\nGreen, blue and yellow the canvas is faint\nAnd lacking determination\n\nIf you're only playing, I can't let you win\nMy intent is as focused as always has been\nI might not escape your appeal and your charm\nBut I am chameleon also\n\nCan't get close\nInsecure\nThe fountains of effort\nI'm putting on your fort\nTranscending my conscience\nAnd try to convince you to\nCome too close\nAnd stay just there\nI'm not not even hiding\nIt's all about fighting\nFor getting rid of this\nChameleon behaviour of yours ",
