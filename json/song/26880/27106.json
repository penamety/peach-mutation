  "info": "2nd place in combined demo compo at Main 2009\n\nLyrics:\nI thought it would be easy but it was not \nI'm back at the start with a blunderbuss \n\nAlways had a lot of things \nAlways had a lot of things \nAlways had a lot of things to do \n\nAlways had a lot of things \nAlways had a lot of things \nAlways had a lot of things to do \n\nI thought it would be easy but it was not \nIt's proven, it's proven with my blunderbuss \nThe feeble marks it leaves when it triggers \nYou can have my blunderbuss \nAs long as you will promise to polish it and laugh with it and then \nKill a lot of men with it \n\nI always had a lot of things \nAlways had a lot of things \nAlways had a lot of things to do \n\nAlways had a lot of things \nAlways had a lot of things \nAnd it will grow and then loose all sense I have",
