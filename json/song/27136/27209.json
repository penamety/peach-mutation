  "info": "The music played during the introduction on the Amiga is titled \"git5\". When the author was asked the meaning of this title, he simply replied \"The title git5 was just something quick and easy to type, as I had made loads of tunes over a few months when I first got some tracker software, and was running out of short titles to store them as. So git5 was next on the list.\"",
