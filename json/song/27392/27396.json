  "info": "The tune is inspired by Namco Ridge Racer 4 game on PlayStation. Tracked for futuristic racing game on PC called \"Jet Jumper\". I've tried to bring a \"syntetic\" feeling into this tune by using oldschool demoscenish solo in the middle part.\nMost samples from Apple Garage Band. Impulse Tracker realtime filters used a lot.",
