  "info": "This tune was composed for the best pc-diskmag that\nwas made in Russia at this moment - \"Armor Of Gods\" issue 4.\n16-bit version was released as a single after several requests\nfrom people who wanted it. Warhawk asked me if I can write\nsomething in \"Enigma\" style. I think this tune is not like\n\"Enigma\" very much, but it is kinda mellow and trip-hoppish,\nand it has very clean sound because of the samples.",
