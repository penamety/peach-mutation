  "info": "Again a tune that looks like some fairy-tale music. Some\njazzy breaks in the middle, some hip-hop drums and very, very\nhigh quality instruments (99% of sounds are 16bit). Melody may\nseem a little \"cheesy\" but I like it anyway. It's a pity that\ngood sounds make it bigger. Btw, the song was written in four\ndays, and I spent around 20 hours making it.",
