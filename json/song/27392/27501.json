  "info": "This is my first released 4-channel MOD that was really\ncomposed on Amiga (I bought an A600), while being on vacations\nin the village with my girlfriend and grandma (my old Amiga\nMODs were not released, and all the released ones were made\non PC using St3). This time I plugged my AMiGA to old russian \nblack-and-white TV \"Oreol\" and tracked music in the deep deep \nnight...That was so romantic! Style and sound are inspired by \nMike Oldfield, let's call this a new age/rock tune.",
