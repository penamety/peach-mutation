  "info": "As you may guess, this tune was made as a joke.\nI composed this one for a game on PowerTV console,\nit was a 8 channel chiptune with 8 bit samples.\nLater, I brought back original 16 bit samples\nand decide to release it on 'Toy SongS 3' musicdisk.\nI found myself singing silly melody during listening\nto this tune, so I quickly plugged a microphone and\nsampled my own voice. What is most funny, the vocal\npretending to be quite serious, while music has\nawful chip samples. It's so easy to make a bad sound,\nbut nowdays it's even more easy to make a good sound :)\nSo, I processed vocal and left the rest as it was -\nwho care?.. And of course, it's not a \"ragga\" style :)",
