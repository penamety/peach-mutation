  "info": "I composed this tune long time ago, played on 2 guitars with Tarh/SandS, tracked bass and drums in self made tracker on BK-0010 home computer and recorded it to the tape. Quality was really terrible :)\nThis version based on high quality samples (recorded with pro gears) downsampled to fit into MOD format. It's concept o PostMODism musicdisk!\n\nTwo guitars and bass played and sampled by me, flute and drums recorded by Tangerine (all live), only moog sound was made with software emulator.",
