  "info": "Since the original tune had these really heavy digi-drums, I decided to experiment a bit with these really sharp and \"slappy\" snares, followed by standard, but higher pitched 909-drumkits, with a very high compression ratio, and adding these little nuskool retrig stuffs.\nNot all tune parts are covered, the beginning theme comes back at the end because I didn't like the rest of the original, so I brought back the beginning patterns with some extra melodies I figured from the rest of the song.\n\nAn interesting thing is the game itself. It was prolly the first game I really noticed the music in because the digi-samples sounded so tough and heavy. It was probably the first game where I looked for the name of the composer, and since then I was able to say, \"yes, the music is good, it's HÃ¼lsbeck\" :-) (The another one was prolly Thing Bounces Back)\n\nThe game itself was rather bad if you consider other games in the same genre, it was basically a screen with two wizard-like thingies shooting each other. What really killed the game was a special move, that made the character release a Pac-Man-like chomping thingy which started to pursuit the enemy and it was reasonably faster than the player, so it was only a matter of time before the chomper ate the opponent. This reducted the game to the \"who-can-shoot-that-spell-first-and-then-run-away-as-long-as-possible\" level, which was a shame because of the great music.",
