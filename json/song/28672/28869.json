  "info": "I am NOT a racist, nationalist or anything of the kind. I simply made this song because i thought it to be fun and educational to try sampling vocals and put them into a song. For some reason i stumbled over \"An Historical Hitler Speach\".\n\nMade in Modplug Tracker.\n2010\nJoel Asplund\n\n(Song disabled by moderation - we don't really need \"music\" with Hitler speeches or \"Sieg Heil\" shouts here. Especially not on a server hosted in Germany.)",
