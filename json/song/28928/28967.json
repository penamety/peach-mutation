  "info": " You stand on a cliff just outside a dungeon exit with your party members,\nlooking over a lush green landscape with mountains in the distance. The\nsky is a mix of deep red, orange, and dark blue. Three moons fill the sky\noverhead. It is sunset.\n\nThe world looks so mysterious. It is your first time seeing the world, as\nthe evil empire has locked you and your companions up in the underworld,\nas well as the rest of the population. To them there is no outside. Nor is\nthere a way.\n\nYou discover that you and everyone you have ever known has been lied to\nabout their surroundings. So, you set forth on a journey to discover what\nlies ahead. Good luck, hero.\n\n -Emerald Prism: Introduction to Gaia-\n\n by skyline, on Jan 3, 2001",
