  "info": "Binster brings us a ReMix not from the more commonly known Genesis/SNES Japanese score to Ghouls 'N Ghosts, but the C64 incarnation penned by Tim Follin. Lo-fi and chiptunish elements abound, but there's also shimmering analog pads, spooky theremin-like sine drones, and a strong 80's Billy Idol beat, amongst shinier elements, and even the simpler synth textures are mangled with quick cross-pan modulation and filtering.\n\nMP3 comment :\n[quote]Remix completed for the Tim Follin Tribute Remix Project.[/quote]",
