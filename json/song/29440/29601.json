  "info": "From Reed's website:\n\n\"Death and Taxes... Smash came up with the name of the intro, which became the name of the tune as well. The theme of the intro was going to be dark, mysterious, sad, and so on, so I tried to do something along those lines. Unfortunately in the initial release version we had to downsample the drums (for size) so they sounded like bollocks, but this is (to the best of my knowledge) the uncut version. We also shortened the end part at some point, but I can't remember if this is the shorter or the longer one. As always, the tune could've been made better, but I'm moderately pleased with it.\"\n\nUsed in the Windows 64kb intro Death and Taxes released by Fairlight at Breakpoint 2005 on 28th March, 2005 where it ranked 2nd.",
