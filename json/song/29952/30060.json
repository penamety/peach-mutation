  "info": "[b]Song text:[/b]\nBass Productions presents..\n\nAn arrangement by Chromatic\nDragon and Necros...\n\n___________________________\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDance    of    the   Dead\n///////////////////////////\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<arranged by Chromatic    >\n<Dragon with excerpts from>\n<pieces originally written>\n<and produced by Andrew   >\n<Sega : Necros of Legend  >\n<Design / Psychic Monks / >\n<FM                       >\nThat message above should\nbe clear. There's lots of\noriginal stuff in here, but\nthe main purpose of this is\nan arrangement.\nNote: each arrangement was\nmade from MEMORY. No part\nwas taken directly from any\nof the songs. And if you\ndon't believe me, tough. :>\n\nYou can call this kissing\nass, brown nosing, what you\nwill, but this song aint\nit. Some composers in this\nday and age are so good\nthat other composers start\nto do pieces based on their\noriginal themes. I wrote\nthis because of all that I\nhave heard, Necros is the\nmost influential in what I\nwrite, and in my opinion\nby far and away the most\nrespected tracker on the\nplanet.\n\nWell, enough of the trying\nto fend off controversy...\nlet's skip to the greetz!\n\nSamples from Robert Allen,\nBasehead, Whale Bone, and\nNecros, of course. He also\nadded patterns 50-59 and\ngussied it up! Mucho thanx.\n\nGreets to:\n\nBase, k8to, Pop, GD, Hacker\nCC, Danc, Maelcum, DD, Miss\nSaigon, Sirrus, etc..\n\nAll in all, I really hope\nyou enjoy listening to this\npiece as much as I enjoyed\ntracking it. Took me a\nwhole evening, it being\n7:00 AM now and I only just\ngot off IRC last night\ngetting Orbital 2 and\nEternity... man, this stuff\nis an addiction! :)\n\nCya!\n\nChromatic Dragon of Bass\nProductions / Eclipse /\nBVD / AFL / CIO / KGB /\nBlah, blah...   Email me at\nabrandon@annap.infi.net\n\nPs: Can you spot all the\nNecros tunes? <g>\n\nHere they are:\n\n- Infinity <Necros/Khyron>\n- Mystic\n- Hyper Control v3.0\n- Dimension 2012\n- Ascent of the Cloud Eagle",
