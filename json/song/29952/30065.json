  "info": "Accidental Ray of Sun\nel blanco [fulcrum]\n(4:05)\n\nGreetz to fulcrum members, Yannick\nYannick for making MT2, etc. etc.\n\nThis is my second tune for fulcrum. This started off completely different, and rapidly turned into this as I messed around with the original 4 parts of the phrase/progression. I just kept tossing on and removing layers until I found something I really liked. Structurally it's pretty boring, the same thing over and over with new layers here and there, one key change up 3 half-steps, climax....then work it's way out.",
