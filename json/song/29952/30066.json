  "info": "Accidental Ray of Sun (piano mix)\nel blanco\n[fulcrum]\n5:08\n\nI really liked the full mix of \"Accidental Ray of Sun\". I also really like playing around with Steinberg's \"The Grand\". I realized the song could be adapted to a piano only tune without much complication -- so I arranged it for the VSTi. \n\nTurned out really nice.\n\nDue to some flakiness in \"The Grand\" I split the piano up between two different VSTi so it would have enough polyphony for the entire song.",
