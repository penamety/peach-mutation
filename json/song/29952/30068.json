  "info": "Fish Light\nel blanco\n[fulcrum]\n5:32\n\nAfter a bit of a lull and constant interruptions by real-life(TM), finally, another tune.\nGreetz to fulcrum, coplan, others etc.\nI really focused on VSTi usage in this one. Pretty much all the instruments (except for the drums) are VSTis. \nI really enjoy using the Angular Momentum Additive Table Synth by Laif Oddson & Thomas Weber. Just love those delicious sounds it puts out. If only it didn't crash madtracker all the time! I mainly used some presets with a few minor tweaks.\nThe piano is Steinberg's \"The Grand\" run through MT2's flanger to make it fit in with the trance sound.\nThe drums are all samples I had lying around.",
