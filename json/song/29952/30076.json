  "info": "Packard\nel blanco [fulcrum]\n3:04\n\nGreetz to fulcrum peeps.\n\nI guess I got inspired by a really great sounding DSK VSTis (http://rekkerd.org/dsk-vsti/). There are some super gems in there. My favs are the Analog Matrix and the Asian Dreamz which I somehow managed to combine into this tune.\n\nI'm really super happy at how this turned out, using a Chinese Pipa in the second half really breathed something into this when I got stuck trying to figure out what to do. As soon as I added that instrument, the rest of the song literally fell together.",
