  "info": "Terra Haute\nel blanco\n[fulcrum]\n2:25\n\nThis short little tune was the one I made for our 4k intro \"Bait\" which we entered @ Assembly 2010. Ultimately, we decided to go with Coplan's tune for the intro which is thematically *much* better for an intro with a story about a giant alien space station that eats planets. But I thought I should release this anyways.\n\nIt's 100% 4klang http://4klang.untergrund.net/ which is an amazing little piece of software. It's my first real go at using this thing, so I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Get the .4kp file from http://fulcrum.antisoc.net/ if you want to hear this thing. Otherwise hunt and poke around as I pretty much just used the presets.",
