  "info": "\"This one was definitely the most serious work of mine when finished (now I've found a couple of controversial harmonic solutions that sound quite irritating to my ear!). It has influences (I hope not too clearly) from Jogeir Liljedahl, Bjorn Lynne and Vangelis, but also from Kenny Gand even Queen. I guess I spent about 100 working hours (about 3 months) with this one.\"",
