  "info": "Composed to accompany the release of a Sailor Moon Fanfiction novel of the same name. Technically a marvel as it ran aground against the pattern limit of Octalyzer STe and was a staggering 830KB (only possible on the ST/e by extended-formatting your disk!) It would have been longer, otherwise.",
