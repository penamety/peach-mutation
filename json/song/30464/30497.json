  "info": "Created - January X, 2003\nHence the name, this song uses a very Egyptian-sounding scale. This and Turn Back Time were both submitted to chiptune.com (which I forgot about) and then later submitted to the Big Chip Compo #5, which apparently caused some huge scandal because I had already released the songs. The dude who runs the Big Chip Compos bitched me out on IRC for that, but after that things were cool.\nSide note: To add insult to injury, this song didn't even place very well.",
