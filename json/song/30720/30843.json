If you're a tracker,\nI'm always interested in talking tunes and exchanging techniques.\nI'm usually available for doing game or demo music. In other news, Hyper\nBBS has closed down, so you can no longer pick up my music there. I'm\nlooking for a new way of getting my tunes distributed. If you know of any\neffective, free way of distributing music over the internet, I want to\nknow about it.\n\nMauricio: If you're reading this, e-mail me now!
