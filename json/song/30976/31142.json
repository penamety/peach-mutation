  "info": "[b]Virt's comments:[/b]\n\"I wrote this after my dog, Nugget, recovered from being terribly sick. Let's just say he ate a scrap of fabric and it ...didn't come out. After a couple of days he was in bad shape, dehydrated and in constant pain. Without emergency surgery, things didn't look good.\n\nWell, as luck would have it, on the very morning that we were due to discuss said surgery, the problem resolved itself.\nOn his walk, in front of a bunch of little kids. \"Oh look a puppy, he is cute, what's his EWWWWWWWWWWW.\"\n\nThis is the music that was playing in my head as we joyfully skipped the whole way home. I transcribed it out of my head, for you to hear. It may or may not be the best music ever written to celebrate a dog crapping.\"",
