  "info": "I had sent around a few of my unfinished tunes to a friend and he liked this one best. So I decided to finish it. Special thanx to: sPartanen, bauer, wiseman, mickrip, Jeroen Tel, BitArts\n\n* Random alien invasion news reporter. He talks about Giant Crabs, so I decided to name the song after an E3 Meme. \"Hit the giant enemy crab on it's weak spot for massive damage\". \"Based on famous japanese battles which took place\" (against giant crabs? :rofl: )",
