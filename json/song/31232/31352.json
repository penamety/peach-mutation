  "info": "Hellas! well what can i say. lemmeh explain how it came to all this nuclear disaster! some days back a mate of mine told me via fakebook that he liked my paranoimia remix and that it's on nectarine. i was surprised and checked nectarine. and to my bigger surprise their were even more tracks of mine. so i wanted to upload some more of mine, and well. registration told me \"username already in use\".. UH?! i was registered there already and totally forgot about it. well i've logged in and saw the thread about this alienated musicdisk. said to myself \"hey, you've got this old track somewhere in the dust\". so yea i told the necta peops that i'd contribute aswell. the track itself is very old. i started it in 1999 i think. i never finished it until this weekend. the project file grew up to 25mb.. ;-)\n\nRenoise / dNb MASSIVE!!!",
