  "info": "Dating back to June 2010, maybe earlier, this track was originally an experiment, or more specifically - an attempt to recreate the Linndrum percussion sounds as they are heard in Laserdance tracks, using Filters, EQs, Delays, Reverbs and whatnot. Gradually it became my goal to reconstruct the spacesynth sound in general, having Laserdance as a guide, for their sound was what I wanted to achieve from the beginning. I tried to get as close to that sound as I could: I used Korg Polysix sawstabs, Linndrum percussion, Juno-106 bassline, Oberheim saw leads, ESQ1 bells and syncleads; I used orchestra stabs and a repeating melody pattern, sticking to the 5 and a half minute \"time standard\" of their Changing Times album (which I still like the most). Can you imagine a genre that has closer to alien invasions than spacesynth? I can't.",
