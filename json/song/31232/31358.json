  "info": "Boy has this song been lying around for a long time. This is one of the first songs I made for renoise. I've never been quite happy with it. So now when I recently installed a few new vsti's I decided to finish it up. Once done the song had the same title as it had a year ago. \"New Template\". So I sent the song to a few friends and asked if they could come up with a neat songname for me.\t\nHere's the results: \"Temple of ...\", \"Contra Sidescroller Level from 1993\", \"Nightscape Fencing\" So I decided to mash it up a bit, and well, yeah that's it. :)        \nThanx to: \"Tatsujin, cgmonkey & Metal-Ridley\" for coming up with the name.        \nThanx to: \"overcoat\" for making me adjust some notes        \nOh and thanx to: maep, prowler & fishboy876 for making this possible",
