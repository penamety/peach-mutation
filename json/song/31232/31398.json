  "info": "This track was done during a few days after the Christmas Eve of 2010 and finished on the 27th.\n\nThe aim was pretty much achieved: I wanted to imitate Michiel Van Der Kuy's sound from the 90s, as it is heard in the tracks he made for singers as well.\n\nI heard a few of these 12\" singles countless times and tried to maintain the same style. I used contemporary synths and fiddled with the post-processing a lot.\n\nI have lyrics prepared as well, hence the structure. A vocoder version will most probably follow, and, when the time comes, a female singer.\n\nThat's about it. Long live Michiel Van Der Kuy :)\n\n12/27/2010",
