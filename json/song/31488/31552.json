  "info": "From a 11 second long loop i made a while back, me [Kanonat] and Gustav [LargerThanLink] sat down and thought real hard.\nWe spent one day making the song to about 1:19 long.\nI said at this time, as i had to go home:\nSome songs feel like they don't deserve to be worked more with, this one on the other hand... oh my god, we have to make it alteast twice as long!\nSo the day after i went to his house again and we composed the rest of this epic piece.\nI am quite positive - this is the best song i've ever worked with up to this date during my ~3 years of music making =)\nEnjoy big time!\n\n",
