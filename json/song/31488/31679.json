  "info": "This track is a remix of an old module by Azazel called \"fractured.ni\". The only things left from the old module however are the vocals and the respective chord sequence. Practically everything else is my own.\nI slowed the whole thing down a lot, for I wanted to go for a more dance-paced BPM.\n\nNothing mind-blowing in my opinion, just a few ideas thrown together.\nDidn't take much time, after the initial trial-and-error syncing of the slowed vocals to the right BPM, it was a few day's work.\n\n26th of January 2011",
