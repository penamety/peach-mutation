It's my first completed tune using Famitracker, and it's nowhere near as good as my other songs, so after you listen to this, go listen to them instead.\n\n[url=http://8bc.org/items/music/Flamerepellent.mp3]Download MP3 (128 kbps)[/url]\n[url=http://2a03.free.fr/dl.php?file=2785]Download FTM[/url]\n[url=http://famitracker.shoodot.net/downloads.php]Download Famitracker (Windows)[/url]",
