  "info": "Rush 2049 (Nintendo 64).\nPublished by Midway Games \n\nComments :-I had a lot of fun doing this one, after composing a bunch of orchestral music for Gauntlet Dark Legacy, and Factor 5 finally released their Musyx system for the N64 I managed to get past that 6 channel limitation that had dogged me in Rush 2, so I was really able to go to town a bit, but at the same time still being kept at gunpoint on memory restrictions..  I think all this music AND all the sound effects on the game fit into 3.5 meg of cart space, (massive amounts compared to the Gauntlet Legends N64 which had 35 tunes in under a megabyte. Ed Logg programmed the N64 version of this, Ed wrote the original Asteroids arcade machine, so it was a lot of fun working with him and the other guys there. You Really need to crank the bass for this stuff. \n\nRush 2049 Bassy Tune - I put this tune on Garageband.com and it went to #1 in the techno charts.. its like #15 or so of all time on there..",
