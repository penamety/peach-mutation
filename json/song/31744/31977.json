  "info": "This is the second italo track after \"One More Time\" done in the style of Michiel van der Kuy's vocal production from the 80s/90s.\n\nThis time also more experimentation with the bass, and with the drumkit as well. Especially the drumkit is quite elaborate and took a lot of time to make.\n\nOnce more I got a bit closer to the style I am after, and that was the goal after all.\n\nI don't have full lyrics written yet for this piece, but I already have something to start from, so I hope for a vocoder and/or vocal version as well.\n\nFebruary 02, 2011",
