  "info": "haven't done trance stuff like this for a while, threw it together in about a week of playing around with Vanguard.. all the patches were created by me specifically for the song, since most of the presets that were included weren't really spectacular.. put this together in FL Studio, all the percussive loops were created with sets of single samples except maybe for a fill or two. Tons of loops out there sound over-produced, can't really help that if the target musician is expected to be someone who doesn't put their own percussion together anyway.. I wrote this thinking that in most trance the transitions take FOREVER, I guess at about 5:30 in length though I'm really not contributing to the solution.. oh well. Greets to Titan and the C64 scene, still enjoying the demos from X2010! Might toss this on the next compilation, if it fits..",
