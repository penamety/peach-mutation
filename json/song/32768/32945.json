  "info": "Lots of fun writing this track, wanted something hard for the first song in the new album. Everything was done in FL Studio 9, synth work is entirely FL plugins. :) Guitar is my own fender strat which was multisampled (cause I really can't play!) and run through the free JCM900 amp simulator VST. Mastered the track with Buzzroom's BuzMaxi3 and BCL201 which are excellent dynamics VSTs. Vocals were recorded through my laptop's built-in mic, it's terrible but I don't have any recording equipment. :P Greets to everyone in Titan, I haven't forgotten you! Also greets to everyone involved in the C64 scene, after over 25 years you guys are still discovering fascinating things to do with it! :) If you like this track you can always check out the other stuff at Sanxion7.com - free album downloads :)",
