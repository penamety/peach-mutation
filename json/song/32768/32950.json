  "info": "There isn't really much to say about \"21 September\".\nI wanted to do something different from the norm and to remove some dust from one of my hardware synths.\nSo, basically, i did an atmospheric electro-minimal track; most of the sounds come out from the Virus C synth and it was sequenced in Ableton Live; about 2 afternoons of work.\nHope you like it!",
