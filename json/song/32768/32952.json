  "info": "Greetings to you satellites! PsychNerD here presenting you Æeon (Aeon). A simply structured electro-house track, using complex synthesis sounds coming mainly from custom G2X modular patches. A nice blend of chill in the back and punch in the front sharing sound elements with Voyager 1 released on SoS Vol 1. A scroller is nothing without greetings so : Thanks to Ziphoid for getting me back into the Scene a couple of years ago and everyone involved in SceneSat. Greetings to every listener hanging around during the \"Levels\" shows, you know who you are and you are all very important to me. Love and respect to my family (now meaning wife and kids) for giving me the time to disappear in the studio and do some work when inspiration is hanging around. Head to http://psychnerd.ca for more. PsychNerD Off!",
