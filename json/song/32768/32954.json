  "info": "Hey everyone, Hoffman / Unstable Label here.  This tune started life as a bootleg remix of a Police album track called King of Pain.  I had put together a breakbeat tune using the vocal hook from the track and wrote the chords around it.  Nothing really happened with that tune but last year I dug the chords out and made them into a lush techno tune.  Written using Cubase 3 with a bunch of plugins.  The most notable plugin being Sugar Bytes Robotronic, a dirty little vocoder plugin.  Neat little trick I discovered was to vocode a drum loop then push the chord structure through it, give a really nice rhythmic feel.  The track is called Ascension because the chord structure gives that feel of rising swelling euphoria.  You can guess hazard why I have an affiliation with that kind of feeling ;) Anyway, click my other tune on this compilation for greets and shout outs ;)",
