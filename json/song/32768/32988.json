  "info": "Timbral was playing a cool oldschool \nlive set at Evoke 2010. I liked it quite a bit, so I had to go and download \nsome more of his music from the net. \nA 2010 live set of his had \nthis strangely named, fun and catchy tune that started playing in \nmy head every now and then. \n\n\nWhen you play a chiptune in your head, at some point\n your imagination kind of starts adding elements to it, breaking\n the technical limitations of the original chip. (Or that's \nwhat happens to me anyway.) \nEventually I decided I might as\n well compose this remix in FL Studio and play it from the speakers\n instead of just the brain. Here you go.",
