  "info": "Hi Freaks…I hope you are spending a good time with the Sound of Scenesat Vol II…Welcome to the French section of this compilation. You again ? I'll end up thinking that you enjoy reading my texts :P So for the younger crowd…This music is a remix of an Amiga mod composed by \"Bit Arts\" that has been released in the Red Sector Megademo. If you're 30-40 years old, this music sounds familiar to you of course :) unless if you owned an Atari ST (This war will never end ahahah)…So the track…Ah yes the track…Well… the original mod has a huge quality (again, congrats to Bit Arts for this masterpieces on Amiga, I can't say how much time I have listened to that one) and it's a bit difficult make something better…But I wanted to create something in 16bits and I hope you'll enjoy it, and for you younger guys, I hope you'll discover a great track. bye bye",
