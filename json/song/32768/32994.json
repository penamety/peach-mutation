  "info": "My neighbour and I usually watch movies together in my home cinema regularly.\nHowever, while having some beers meanwhile, he needs to take a pee quite often, up to five times a movie. So over the last months, everytime we needed to have that special break I grabbed an acoustic guitar and started jamming around for a minute or two until he was done. I saved some of the riffs and  ideas in mind and after a couple of weeks, this song was basically finished. Only composed during those piss breaks. I recorded it in basically one day in the studio and named it using an online song title generator. It should have been named “F*ckin’ Small Bladder” though. I hope you enjoy it.\n",
