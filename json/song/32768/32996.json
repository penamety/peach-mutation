  "info": "I started writing this track several years ago but never got around to finishing it, as I never found the right sounds for this. I always wanted the song to mirror a lighter side with happier arrangements as compared to the onslaught of dispair in the end section. My songs tend to be on the heavier, darker side. I guess this makes no exception. I'm very glad to be a part of Sounds of Scenesat 2 and to be able to contribute.\n\nGreetings go to: SceneSat, Accession, Dekadence, Primitive, Darklite, Umlaut Design, Brainstorm, Spaceballs, Boozoholics and all the great people I have met during parties and whatnots!",
