  "info": "Old-school happiness comes pouring through the PA... This track is called Spaceflight and was written specifically for this massive Scenesat release. With this tune, I just wanted to go back in time and do something completely melodious and give in to every happy, stupid melody that came to mind. At the same time, I wanted to use old-school instruments to give it a somewhat wobbly analog touch. Anyways, I enjoyed composing the tune a lot and hopefully you all can find something in it that tickles a nerve.\n",
