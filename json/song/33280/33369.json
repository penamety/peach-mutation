  "info": "Hi there. As I promised on the occasion of publishing \"Winter Funk\" song - today I put the entire and full version of \"Critical Error\" ZX demo original score, that includes the \"Winter Funk\" song too. It also contains an additional lost 'intro' part that isn't present in the demo, as I lost the sources and now I have it only in a recording form. It's quite a long song, different in every demo's part, having various styles and moods of chiptune music. This is a synthetic-music part of the score, there is however also a digital part (outro) available on the Internet under a name \"Kaminari\": [song]33373[/song]\nGreetz, ppl.",
