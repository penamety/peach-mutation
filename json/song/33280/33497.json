I'm gonna miss the parties around. Oh-woa-ow\nWe had the best times of our lives. \nEven when Lukelove was p-p-playing \n\nRemember that strange weird tune going: \n\"Indi indi indi indi indi indian\"\nOr the time when we danced to some weird finnish demo songs\nThis is our tribute song to, the scene\n\n[b]BRIDGE:[/b]\nNectarine... Forever\nNectarine... don't GO\nNectarine... Forever\nNectarine.. OH -beep- GO!\n\n[b]CHORUS:[/b]\nOpen  your beer, we're gonna demo party...\nBoozing all night, until we've won the compo...\nPour up your beer, in the heat of the sauna...\nBoozing all night, until the sun has set.\n\n[b]VERSE 2:[/b]\n-beep-ed up, I went out for a smoke, \nLooked up at the stars, felt the breeze of the cars.\na Girl in her top, with her long-legs she rocks.\nI can feel the urge I'm not one of the nerds.\nSeven~eight cold, I started to mumble\njumbo mumbo, just believed that I'm Rambo.\nHolding this gun, locked and loaded\nI'm feeling mighty, mighty tighty \nRemember that strange tune going woa oh, uh   oh oh\n\nBridge/2\nChorus x3",
