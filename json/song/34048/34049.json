  "info": "It always annoyed me that the original 1995 XM had so much kick drum in it, because I made it using only only a small radio with almost no bass. Here's a more balanced mix I made in 2004 in Cubase. I took the original XM's tracks/channels and mixed them with a little bit of compression, EQ etc. The solo lead sound has some kind of filter/overdrive.",
