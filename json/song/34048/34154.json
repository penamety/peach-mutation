  "info": "More info about Ott and Bluemoon (http://www.bluemoon.ee)\n\nOtt was the only musician in the Bluemoon team.\n\nBluemoon was a small team from Estonia who produced SoundClub, a sequencer for DOS and later Windows. SoundClub introduced me to trackers and sequencers.\n\nPopcorn was a hit tune remixed and used for the tutorial-introduction to the DOS version of the program (1993).\n\nSoundClub was released free in the early 2000. For interested people, it can be downloaded here: http://www.bluemoon.ee/history/scwin/index.html\n\nSkyroads was a game produced by Bluemoon and the tunes (which you can find here on necta) were also written by Ott.\n\nBluemoon also brought the amazing peer-to-peer (P2P) technology and it is such a shame that the world knows so little about them. That's why I am writing this.\n\nThe team: http://www.bluemoon.ee/team/index.html",
