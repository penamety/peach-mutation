  "info": "Written for the TRSAC 2011 Music Compo (4th place, yeeaahh!! )\n\n4 days of sweat and tears went into this track,  not counting the final mixing and recording,  which took another few days. But here it is, solid and done!!!! This was my first time at TRSAC in Denmark and I met A LOT of cool people and made some new friends too!! A BIG shout out to Punqtured of Fnuque for the great Copenhagen tour and for being such a fantastic host. Also Ralph (Fnuque) for the great chat about quiver, I am already having a blast creating tracks with it! Also thumbs up high to Puryx for delivering the most excellent party experience. And everyone who sent in their compo entries AND of course everyone who voted for my track! (: (: (:\n\nMore greetings to my friends and family all over the globe - you know I love you guys! \n\nSend an email to demoscene@sunspire-records.com if you got projects going and need a musician!!\n\n..:: P L A Y  I T  L O U D ! ! ! ::..",
