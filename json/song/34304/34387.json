  "info": "Can’t you see that my opinion on you \nis made up from the art of showing that you don’t have a clue \nand I got that you’re pitying me \nalthough your lacking self-awareness is your sole reason to be \nI believe your beliefs must be true \nbecause the world you live inside approves your own point of view \nonly that you’re worshipping god \nexpresses powerful denial of the things that you’re not \n\nChorus \n\nYour ignorance is bliss, I suck at this, \nmy questions pile while you'll still pray \nYour deep convictions are just fed by evidence that contradicts \nit’s self-delusion, no conflicts \n\nQuench your thirst for the utmost enlightment \nturn your fear into the right to be afraid to be frightened \nall your sins are deleted - only wishful thinking, \nyes, my soul will rot in hell but yours is already stinking \nyour servility, it makes a walking dead I can assure \nyou are the prey of tyranny, enslaved for life and then you’re \ndropped dead, vanished, gone forever \nbut still obeying the master, it’s your final endeavour \n\nChorus \n\nBridge \n\nEverything’s a matter of perspective \nstill your truth’s highly selective \nthe wish for heaven is effective \nit is your primary objective \n\nSolo \n\nChorus",
