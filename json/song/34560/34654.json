  "info": "Traves La Nieve is another italo-disco track I made in the late 80s Hotsound and Made Up Records style.\n\nAgain, it follows the principles of the above-mentioned production, using the same gear and song structure. Everything is here, from lush, digital Korg M1 sounds and irregular, raw analog bass; to mighty saw stabs and plenty of percussion.\n\nComposing was real fun and easy, because I had already made a few italo tracks before, and so it only took a few days. I really enjoyed work on this one.\n\nOh, and to make the Hotsound Records tradition even more alive, I gave it a spanish title ;)\n\nI guess that's it, finishing on December 5, relaxed just before the exams :)",
