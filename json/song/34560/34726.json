  "info": "After more than year and a half from finishing Grey-Eyed Girl, the final piece in the series, the Brown-Eyed Girl, is finished.\n\nThis song represents the Brown-eyed Girl, the symbol of devotion and trust.\n\nThe first part stands for the feeling you get when you see her for the first time - mellow and divine.\n\nAfter a rush of feelings, you forget about her, only to find yourself talking to her more and more often, with the same feelings in your head. This is represented by the second part.\n\nSooner than you might think, you get to know each other very well, both of you depending and trusting the other one, sharing all your lives. The third part stands for the intense feelings you both feel you're together.\n\nNothing is ideal though. In every relationship, there are hardships, misunderstandings and quarrels. The fourth part is devoted to these, which may be overcome only by mutual understanding and tolerance.\n\nAfter you're together for some time, it will never be the same as when you first met. However, you can both still feel the feeling you had when your relationship began. And whether it will end because of differences between you, or whether it will go on, that's only up to the two of you...\n---------------------\nEnd of story.\n\nFinished on 14th of December, 2011",
