  "info": "This song is the final piece to the 'Eyes' series, made as a short introduction to the album.\n\nAfter more than two years, the album is complete, with this song being the last puzzle piece.\n\nI don't really have much more to say about it apart from that it was meant to be similar to Memories so the two would constitute a kind of frame to the four 'big' songs.\n\nIt was done in a few evening hours on January 10 and 11, 2012, as a break from studying medieval and renaissance literature :)",
