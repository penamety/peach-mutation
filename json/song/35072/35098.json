  "info": "5.Heroes Of The Last Chance (7:01)\n\nDay turned to night so long ago,\nour weariness had begun to show\nWe had to find a place to stop for the night\n\nA village small was waiting near\nPeople dreaming dreams full of fear\nuntil wiped away by rays of the light...\n \nSo pale and sad was the look on their face,\nliving in this grim and forbidding place\nDisturbing news from the fields not far away\n \nWas rumoured, there a black fire burned\nUnnatural storms, some did not return\nafter work had ended for the day\n \nWe would have to go and investigate,\neven if it meant riding to our fate...\n\n  We're the Heroes of the last chance,\n  riders of the night\n  Against terror and violence,\n  we will forever fight.\n\n  With our fists raised high into the air\n  we'll ride to the battlefield\n  So we know this bloody nightmare\n  will end, destroyed by our steel.",
