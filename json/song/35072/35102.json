  "info": "BLOOD BROTHERS (Iron Maiden)\n--------------\n\nAnd if you're taking a look through the garden of life,\nwhat do you think you'd expect you would see ?\nJust like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life\nand, in the river, reflections of me\n\nJust for a second, a glimpse of my father I see\nand in a movement, he beckons to me\nAnd in a moment, the memories are all that remain,\nand all the wounds are reopening again\n\n  We're blood brothers...\n\nAnd as you look all around at the world in dismay,\nwhat do you see, do you think we have learned ?\nNot if you're taking a look at the war torn affray,\nout in the streets where the babies are burned...\n\n  We're blood brothers...\n\nThere are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world\nThere are times I'm ashamed of us all\nWhen you're floating on all the emotion you feel,\nand reflecting the good and the bad\n\nWill we ever know what the answer to life really is ?\nCan you really tell me what life is ?\nMaybe all the things that you know that are precious to you\ncould be swept away by fate's own hand...\n\n  We're blood brothers...\n\nWhen you think that we've used all our chances\nand the chance to make everything right,\nkeep on making the same old mistakes\nmakes untipping the balance so easy...\nWhen we're living our lives on the edge,\nsay a prayer on the book of the dead...\n\n  We're blood brothers...\n\n... and if you're taking a walk through the garden of life...\n\n\n------------------\n\nOriginal version written and composed by Steve Harris\nAll guitars and new arrangements by Malekith\nAll vocals by Cadaver\nSample credits : strings and bassoon from Claymore, horns from the T.I.R\nwebsite (which is closed nowadays), fingered bass from Leonardo Del Prete,\ncymbals from Einherjar/Cadaver, and other drums collected from various\nsources.\n\nHail to everyone on the metalscene !\n\ncontact me at : lordlg@mangoosta.net\nsong archive : http://malekith.free.fr\n",
