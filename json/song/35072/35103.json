  "info": "--------------------\n\nTracked by Malekith for the Metal Madness musicdisk, available at\nhttp://www.trackedaggression.com\nAll guitars and backing vocals were recorded by Malekith in September\n2002. Lead vocals were sung by BHS on 29/09/2002.\n\nOriginally by Running Wild, available on their \"Gates To Purgatory\" debut\nalbum (1984) and on the \"First Years Of Piracy\" collection of\nre-recordings (1991). This cover is actually based upon this version,\nbecause it has much more energy than the original (heavier sound, faster\nchorus, better backing vocals etc...)\n\nSomething quite amusing : read the lyrics, you'll notice that the words on\nRW's two first albums had nothing to do with their famous pirate-stuff...\nInstead, there's true excellent evil lyrics :) and I think the contrast\nwith the rock-sounding riffs is quite funny :)\n\nThis is certainly one of my favourite Running Wild songs, and has one of\nmy favorite choruses. It's just too bad they don't play it live anymore...\nmaybe it's because this song wasn't written by their mastermind\nRock'n'Rolf, but by their former second guitarist who left a couple of\nyears later, Preacher ? Singing that chorus at a show must have been truly\namazing, I wish I were one of the old farts who heard that :D\n\n\ncontact me at : lordlg@mangoosta.net\nor visit my mod archive : http://malekith.free.fr\n\n\nHails to : Cadaver, Tarantula, Hakan, Dragon, Einherjar and everyone else\nfrom the metalscene. Thanks to Friz for organizing the disk !\n\n\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n\nAnd finally, the truly intellectual lyrics, so that you can sing along\nwith the \"magnificent choirs\" (ahem...) formed by BHS and me (note : the\nwimpy voice in the background is mine :D)\n\n\nPaint in subways, paint in buses\nWith your Edding big black pentagrams\nBlack metal graffitis are thrown against the wall\n\nCrucifixes are inversed,\npictures are signed by the triple six\nBlack metal art is shocking law and order men\n\n(bridge)\nRockers of the underground,\nblack and heavy is our sound\n\n\nLost the money, lost the job\nBeing catched by the cob\nI am living not the role that you wanna give to me\n\nLiving life my own way,\nnot tomorrow, but today\nYou are against me, but I tell you : K.M.A !\n\n(repeat bridge)\n\n (chorus)\n  We are prisoners of our time,\n  but we are still alive\n  Fight for the Freedom, Fight for the Right\n  We are Running Wild !\n\n*------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n",
