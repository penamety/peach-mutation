  "info": "REVELATIONS - 6'50\n\n\nby Iron Maiden - Cover by Malekith\nTracked for \"BEST OF THE FANS II\" musicdisk\n\nOne of my favorite Maiden songs, I first wanted to track it for BOTF 1 but\nI didn't have enough good samples to do an \"above-average\" mod. Then I\nfound some good metal mods, I asked permission to rip some samples (mainly\nsolo guitar and drums) and now, here it is...\n\n\nClean guitar parts redone with Hybrido's pack. I kept the original samples\n'cos i wasn't gonna do the whole module again (something else to do :-))\nOriginal samples by Zack and Betrayer.\n\n\n\ncontact me : malekith@listen.to\nICQ : 49731906\nmy site : http://listen.to/malekith",
