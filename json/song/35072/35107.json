  "info": "PLAIN OF BONES\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten, arranged and tracked by Malekith\nReleased on 29/04/99 (my first released original tune)\nRedone during December '99 for my new website (in fact, I just checked the\nguitar volumes, modified a little bit the drum track and added some\nbrass and strings...)\n\nThis tune was inspired mainly by Edguy and Rhapsody, and also Maiden for\nthe harmonized guitar solos :)\n\nThanks to Betrayer for guitar samples and to everyone who helped me.\nHails to Dragon, Hakan, Cadaver, Gnome, and all the Metalscene\nmembers and all those who support metal tracking.\nAnd of course you, if you like this !\n\nPlaying time : 6'34\n\nIf you prefer the song without the vocal sample, mute the channels 25 and\n26\n\n\nENJOY THIS !\nMalekith : http://listen.to/malekith \nemail at : malekith@listen.to\nICQ : 49731906\n\n\n\n\nLYRICS :\n\n\nAs soon as the sun appears in the sky\nThe battle horns begin to ring around\nOur proud soldiers will win or will die\nWe're so mighty, they'll perish without a sound\n\n We won't take any prisoners\n No one must survive !\n\nTheir peasants have only their forks\nOur fierce, dangerous army crushes them down\nKills the young men, expels the folks\nWe hang their lord on a tree and take his crown\n\n We slaughtered all of them with rage\n Now all life is gone\n We've turned their whole damned village\n Into a plain of bones                      [CHORUS]\n\n\nWe raped and killed, then took their gold\nNo one remained in the place, a field of corpses\nTired but proud of reaching their goal\nThe soldiers went back home without remorse\n\n[repeat chorus 2x]\n\n We've turned their whole damned village\n Into a plain of bones...  a plain of bones...\n\nBehind us we leave a plain of bones !\n",
