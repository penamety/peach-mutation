  "info": "MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE\n\n\n\nWritten by Iron Maiden\nCovered by Malekith for BEST OF THE FANS III musicdisk.\n\nWell, i don't have much to say here... A fast heavy tune with a very quiet\nintro, a good old Maiden song with Di'Anno. I didn't use any \"vocal\"\nsample because I think the guitar melodies are enough (the vocal parts are\nnearly the same).\n\nThanx to Betrayer and Cadaver for samples.\nHails to Dragon, Hakan and everyone I have forgotten, I don't write all\nthe names but you know who you are ! UP THE IRONS !\n\nPlaying time : 4'07. Hope you like this !\n\n\n\nMalekith\nemail : malekith@listen.to\nURL : http://listen.to/malekith\n\n",
