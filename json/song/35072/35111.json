  "info": "SIGN OF THE HAMMER\n\n\n\nMusic and lyrics by Manowar\nCovered by Malekith for The Wicker Man's Manowar tribute\n\nAll guitar & bass recordings, editing, tracking, orchestration and stuff\nby Malekith. Vocals sung by BHS.\n\n\n\nThis song was started several months ago, and only last week I managed to\nrecord the definitive guitars. Moreover, from the beginning I wanted to\ninclude custom bass samples, because DeMaio's incredible playing is an\nimportant part of Manowar's genius and can't be covered with my usual\nsingle-sample bass instrument :) So that song required lots of work, some\nof the vocals were really satan to sing properly (that evil high \"Black\nis the wind !!!\") but finally, I'm quite pleased with the result.\n\nAnd for the usual Children Of The Rising Sun news (I guess you have begun\nbeing bored with this, but don't worry, only two songs are currently\nincomplete) : well, choir recordings were slowed down because of year end\nexams... Usually, only few (less than 25%) of the recordings are good,\nmost are slightly out of time or out of tune, and the smallest error can\neasily cause chaos in choir recordings...\n\n\nThere are some changes from the original songs : the two guitars,\norchestrations in the chorus, intro and outro which were shortened...\nDie-hard Manowar fans will certainly notice that this version is closer to\ntheir live performance on the Hell On Wheels CD than to the original '84\nversion... mainly because that live album truly amazed me with its almost\nperfect sound, the beauty and the ass-kicking power of their\ninterpretation of the old anthems, even if it mainly depends on Adams's\nvocal condition...\n\nSo enough babbling now, it's time to let Manowar's magic speak by itself.\nHail & Kill, and have fun !\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks go to BHS for his vocals.\n\nA loud and proud Hail to : Wicker Man, BHS, Cadaver, Cthulhu, Chakotay,\nEinherjar, Holyblood, Darkium and everyone from the Metalscene or\n#metaltrax - Skarf, Wogoethe and all the Goats of the present, past and\nfuture - all my brothers from Meuhtal (A POIL LES OUUUUUUUURS !!!) and,\nlast but not least, each and every metal fan of and out of this world.\nKeep the faith ! Soon the day will come.....\n\nDamn, should go to bed :)\n\n\n\n        Malekith\n\nURL : http://listen.to/malekith (new site is coming soon)\n\nemail : lordlg@mangoosta.net\n\n\n                                --------------\n\n\nSIGN OF THE HAMMER\n(DeMaio)\n\n\nThe Spell has been broken, the Curse has been lifted\nBlack is the Wind on the heels of the Gifted\nFour sworn a Vengeance, see the Hate in our eyes\nCalled by the Gods and given a Sign\n\n (chorus)\n  Onward pounding, into Glory ride\n  Sign of the Hammer, be my Guide\n  Final warning, all stand aside\n  Sign of the Hammer, it's my time\n\nPounding, pounding, we are back from the dead\nThose who denied us are delivered instead\nInto the hands of Four sworn to ride\nNow the People will triumph and live by the Sign\n\n (repeat chorus)\n\nThe Spell has been broken, the Curse has been lifted\nBlack is the Wind on the heels of the Gifted\nFour sworn a Vengeance, see the Hate in our eyes\nCalled by the Gods and given a Sign\n \n  Onward pounding, into Glory ride\n  Sign of the Hammer, be my Guide\n  Final warning, all stand aside\n  Old men and young boys... it's my time\n\n  Sign of the Hammer, be my Guide...\n",
