Took me about 10 hours.\n\nThanks to Betrayer and Cadaver for the guitar samples and John Twynam and\nZoso for midifile and tab, they helped me a lot !\n\nHails to Dragon and Hakan, CroW, Amok, Deimos (i have no answer from him\nsince...long, long time), Friz, Corpse and all those who tracked a song\nfor BOTF3. Let's hope this one will be better than the 2nd edition.\n\n\nUp the Irons ! (i will see them live September 9th in Paris, hope it will\nreally kick ass, but i suppose it will...)\n\nemail at : jcgendre@email.impulsor.fr\n\nIf you are a Maiden fan or if you think this music sounds good, check the\nothers BOTF3 tunes on Hakan's Maiden Sound Archive (well, it's probably\nthe place where you got this mod from, i don't remember the url)\n\nThis song is the first track of the \"Somewhere In Time\" album and lasts\nabout 7'20. Hope you like it !\n\n\n                Malekith\n",
