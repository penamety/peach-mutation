  "info": "5th place at Icons 2012 Demoparty in Finland\n\nPossibly my biggest endeavour yet. This song has over 50 audio tracks and instruments and it took a full week to complete. Actually, 'complete' is not the right word, it's merely in a listenable state now ;) The 2nd part with the guitars is losely based on an old idea I had for an .xm track back in 2004.\n\nAs always, I hope you'll enjoy! :)",
