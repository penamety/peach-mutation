  "info": "Orchestral tune inspired by music from the movie \"The Rock\" composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick-Glennie Smith and Hans Zimmer. \n\nI think this tune has a great movie-atmosphere, consisting of different parts trying to portray different moods/settings. I tried to visualize different happenings in a movie while composing this song.\n\nMost samples are \"borrowed\" from the Lizardking song \"Age of Legends\".",
