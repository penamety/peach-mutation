  "info": "MAS_UTrack_V003  Captain Nemo's Last Stand...   By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs   --------------------------------Written on or about Oct/93.  (c)  I would like to take just as  little responsibility for this  little number as possible.  I   was in a crazed stupor when I   wrote it, and I'm just sick     enough to have enjoyed the      results.  Don't ask me why.       The major reason for writing  this was a nasty bass line I    came up with, and memory of that cheap animated show \"The Under- Sea Adventures Of Captain Nemo\" or something like that.  It used to run when I was a lil' nipper and I'll never forget how awful that show was so...               If anyone wants or needs to   contact me for a LEGITIMATE     reason (if I get adds I'll find you and maim you) I can be      reached by snail-mail at:\n              24 Broomfield Crt.\n              Brampton, Ontario,\n              Canada.  L6Z-1T5.\n          I'm working on e-mail access.   I gotta speed, keid, so I'll  bid you goodbye...\n                              Killer Fish",
