  "info": "MAS_UTrack_V003      Canyon Flyin' Blues        By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs\n   --------------------------------\nWritten on or about Aug/93.  (c)\nThis is my first experience with Ultra Tracker, and I like it. It could really use a JUMP effect, though... \n                        This song was based on an old idea I had for a song, years    ago.  I hope you enjoy the song as much as I enjoyed composing  it.\n                               Greetz, in no particular or   definite order, go to:\n          Captain/Image\n   C.C.Catch\n       Ryan Cramer\n     Deathjester\n     Nuke \n           Romeo Knight\n    Lizardking\n      Purple Motion\n     I love the music you guys have written.  Demos come and go, but a good tune can stand the test  of time.  I've heard 4 track MODfiles that blow the hell out of most popular music on the market these days, and the artists     above are probably THE best in  the tracker-composing field, and are using 8 to 32 tracks.         I've just run out of writing  space (32 lines).  Adieu...                     Killer Fish",
