  "info": "MAS_UTrack_V003            No Time!             By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs \n  --------------------------------\nWritten on or about Mar/94.  (c)\n  This song was written as a    response to about 12 deadlines, all of which descended on me    from out of the clear blue sky.   I spent a week of frantic work to get everything done, and when I had nothing left that needed  to be done, this song is how I  burned off the rest of my vast  supply of adrenalin before I    crawled into bed and fell into  a deep, healing sleep.\n            As usual, I have managed to   use a 32 voice tracker to create a song that uses less than 10   channels.  I'm working on wider music files (trust me...) but   they won't be released until I  can listen to them without      openly cringing.  May take a    while...\n                          Greetz go to:\n                 C.C.Catch\n       Ryan Cramer\n     Purple Motion\n   Deathjester\n     Captain/Image\n   Lizardking\n        You guys make great music! \n     Gotta speed, keid... \n                         Killer Fish     ",
