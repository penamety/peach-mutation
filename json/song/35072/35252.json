  "info": "By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)\n   of Late Nite Software Labs   \n--------------------------------\nWritten on or about Mar/94.  (c)\n  This song is dedicated to my  \nabiding obsession with Japanese \nAnime.  Don't ask me what the   \ntwo have to do with each other. \n  Anyways, enjoy the music, and \nI would like to appologize in   \nadvance for any disco-like stuff\nin the song.  It's not my fault,\nreally.  Blame someone else.    \n  I said that I would eventually\ndeliver an ULT file that was    \nwider than 10 channels, and here\nit is.  Don't bug me about the  \nquality, that wasn't part of the\ndeal.  I'll work on making the  \nthe next one sound better.      \n  If you're looking for a really\ngood sample for making chords,  \nget a copy of the sample called \n\"Polysynth Lead I\", above.  Its \nreally quite good to work with, \nand it is devoid of irritating  \nharmonics, so chords don't sound\nodd with it.                    \n  Well, I'm just about out of   \nscrawling space, so I'll sign   \noff now.  Gotta speed, keid...  ",
