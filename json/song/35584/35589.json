  "info": "Begun as a coop project together with Gustav. At the end of our session we said: \"This is not as good as it should be, lets put it on the shelf...\"\nI added: \"Sure. Well, atleast now i have something to work on, should i get a flow.\"\nOn work 3 weeks later i cooked, cleaned, washed, served food for about 30 people, breakfast, lunch and dinner whilst also bringing my laptop beating the sense out of the musical part of my brain.\nAbout 90% of the song was made that day.\nWhen i woke up, i went to work. When i came home, i went to bed. A good day, all in all.",
