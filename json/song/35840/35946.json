  "info": "From [url=http://www.mazedude.com/aa/]The American Album[/url]\n\nTrack # 10 from my epic \"American Album\" remix project. Another experimental track, the goal here was to construct every sound from what was originally a string instrument. So we have some pure pizzicato, plucked violin and cello and all that, but we also have heavily distorted standing bass, manipulated double-fifths, and oodles of other madness. I stayed true to the concept - even in the industrial final phase, every sound in here was created from strings.",
