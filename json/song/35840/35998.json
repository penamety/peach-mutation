  "info": "Made for the Amiga demo Fem by the prank group Laxative Effects. I used the fake nick Mr. Pizza when making music for Laxative Effects.\n\nAll demos were ofcourse unserious, and were most of the time made in Amos. Most of the music I made for that constellation were crap, but this one are actually quite cool :D\n\nI won't out the other members of LAX though :)\n\nBtw. This was not a module. It's streamed with ADPCM decoder in Amiga demo.\n\nDownload & stream:\nhttp://dvibe.se/lofi_fem.html",
