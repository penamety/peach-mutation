  "info": "As quoted from CSDb (\"iAN CooG\"):\n\"random noise?\"\n\nPerhaps this sounds like random noise :P , but in fact this was an attempt to learn how to use the Prophet64 sequencer. So it's like several songs in one song; and I know, the transitions aren't perfect, but hey, there are some parts of that I really like :).\n\nThis was made on, and recorded from, a single 8580 SID chip. Just added some EQ and compressor.\n\nReleased at Grep White 2008 oldschool music compo.\n\nDownload & stream:\nhttp://dvibe.se/lofi_gob.html",
