  "info": "Techno/chip-piece composed for intro-purposes, but I do not remember it being made for a specific one. The filesize is way too big for a chiptune anyway, but the song is not \"stripped\" or optimized to preserve space.\n\nI remember having read a magazine with many rude jokes right before starting to track this piece, hence the name \"Groovie Jokes\".",
