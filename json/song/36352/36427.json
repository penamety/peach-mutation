  "info": "Made on ZX81 with ZXpand and two stereo AY-modules (YM2149) in ZonX standard. \nThis is my very first song made entirely on ZX81 (in original case, with original touch-sense keyboard!! :) :) ). \nI used ZX81 SoundTracker made by Andy Rea. All the modern hardware (ZXpand with AY-Module and Mr-X) made by Sir Morris and Sascha2000.\nSupported by RWAP and Moggy. \nThe work was pretty harsh because ZX81 likes to reset itself without reason. :) But still, it was a great pleasure to work with the machine and surely it's not the last ZX81 chiptune from me. :) ",
