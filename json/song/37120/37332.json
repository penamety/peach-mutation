  "info": "The album \"Tubular Bells 2\" by Mike Oldfield inspired me a lot for this track. My idea was to work mainly in the melody using very sweet sounds as if telling a fairy tale or a bedtime story. At one moment I was blocked to continue after the transition quite dark in the middle of the song. It was very hard to return naturally to a more melodic end of the same kind that the beginning. But finally I won ! Comments are welcomed. Enjoy my little music box !\n",
