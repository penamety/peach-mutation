  "info": "Text from an Atari-Forum.com forum post by YERZMYEY:\n\n\"Last times I was testing how Atari 520ST would behave as a synthesizer in recording studio.\n\nWhat I mean is - in early 70s synthesizers sounded in similar way to later sound-chips, they had rather simple possibilities - it was recording-studio effects what gave the special sound to early electronic music actually, not entirely the synthesizers by themselves, in fact.\n\nSo - I recorded all the required sequencies (with MusicMon) track by track, I added loads of studio effects and... ;)\n\nThe only instrument/sound-source and sequencer is Atari 520ST.\n\nOf course ***HEAVY POST-PRODUCTION*** has been added, to change sound of original sequences totally. Recording studio effects used: track-by-track recording / filters / phasers / choruses / flangers / delays / echoes / reverbs / equalizers / compressors / limiters.\n\nIt shows what Atari micromusic hardware can be used to :)\n\nData of post-production:\n\nHardware:\n- Behringer FEX 800\n- Behringer XENYX 1002 FX\n- ZOOM RFX 2000\n\nSoftware:\n- Sony SoundForge 8.0\n- CoolEdit Pro 2.1\"\n\n",
