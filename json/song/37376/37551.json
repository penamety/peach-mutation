  "info": "NES with Konami VRC6\n\nFeatured in \"HARDWARE GIRLS MAGAZINE vol.1\" - Chiptune Compilation CD Nol.1.\n\nAlso featured in \"Famicompo mini vol.8\" - originals section.\n\nElectro-house thingofajig I made a few months ago. Heavily influenced by A_Rival, so he deserves credit for the style of this song.\nComposed in Famitracker v0.3.7 (2A03 + VRC6). Stereo automation done in post. Visualizations via MIDITrail.\n\nOriginally this was only intended for my live NES chiptune DJ set during \"Hardware Girls Night 3\", hence the \"original mix\"-style repetition for the intro/outro. I wasn't planning to release it beyond that. As with my typical \"make TOTALLY DANZ UNTZ the night before lol!!!!!!!\" routine for every live set I'm invited to, I composed this in a few hours within the wee morning before having to bail for the venue @ Shibuya. Yes, including the vocals. It kinda shows with the ridiculous \"lyrics\". :D\n",
