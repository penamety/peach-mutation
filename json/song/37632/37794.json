  "info": "Yerzmyey/AY-Riders composed the original version of this tune on the ZX Spectrum for Hooy-Program's demo Dizzzruptor. I felt like it could use another melody line, some timer effects and digidrums. Thank you Micha≈Ç for letting me remix the tune. The tune is included in my music demo Meet !Cube.\nEditor: maxYMiser\nRelease date: SillyVenture 2012 ",
