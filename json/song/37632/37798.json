  "info": "Editor: maxYMiser\nThis tune was originally composed for an intro which required clock cycle accurate timings so the tune doesn't use any timer effects. I was inspired by Jochen Hippel's tunes in some games like Rings of Medusa 2, and tried to come up with something similar. The tune is included in my music demo Meet !Cube.\nRelease date: SillyVenture 2012 ",
