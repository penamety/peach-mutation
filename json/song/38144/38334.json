  "info": "This music is certainly one of the most well-known (if not THE most) tunes from the famous hit \"Lemmings\", a game released by Psygnosis on various platforms (Amiga, MS-DOS...) during the early 90s.\n\nThis version is mainly based on the PC/MS-DOS/AdLib port of the game, but has been also inspired by the Amiga version, especially for the sounds.",
