  "info": "Here is my second release of year 2006, and, once again, a new tune from a computer game, this game being \"Operation Stealth\", released as \"James Bond: The Stealth Affair\" in the US, during the early 90s.\n\nThis music is the \"underwater theme\" of the game, and is mainly inspired by the PC/MS-DOS/AdLib version of the original game soundtrack, although it has also been inspired by the Amiga version.",
