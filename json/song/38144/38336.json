  "info": "Not a game music or film soundtrack this time, but a music I started to compose myself as soon as I heard a little piece of oriental music while walking on a street.\n\nSome new and fresh ideas in this song, mainly inspired from the oriental and \"space-sounding\" instruments I've used in it.\n\nAs a result, \"Arabian Feelings\" can be considered considered as a combination of oriental and space-sounding melodies, some parts of them having also been inspired from an excellent music track by Karsten Koch, named \"Jupiter's Orbit\".",
