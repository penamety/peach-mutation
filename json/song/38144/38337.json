  "info": "Along with \"Arabian Feelings\", this song remains one of my favourites among all my personal works.\n\nJust like with \"Arabian Feelings\", I tried to split this song into several parts, either by using different instruments, or by covering different registers.\n\nIf I had to credit someone who inspired me parts of this song, it would be, once again, Karsten Koch, with his excellent \"Hidden Empire\" track. If you like my song, you may also like his one, so, try it out!",
