  "info": "\n\n\"Cracked Nostalgia\" (compo edition, one loop)\nBy gusse & loonie ^ digisonix\n\nStarted in FT2 by Loonie 1999\nFinished in MilkyTracker by Gusse 2013\n4 Channels\n17kb\n\nThere is a little story behind this one.\n\nAfter finalizing a bunch of old tunes without any size/channel restraints I wanted to challenge myself. The goal was to make a little 4chn chip no more than 20kb. Possibly as a contribution for the EDISON 2013 oldschool/tracked music competition.\n\nI scanned through my old workfiles and stumbled upon a few patterns from 1999 I could not remember having made. I got a bit of an inspiration going, came up with an idea for a progression and hammered it out as fast as I could. It ended up the tune you can listen to on this page.\n\n…the thing was I still wasn’t sure about those instigating patterns so I asked around with some old scene friends. Finally it turned out those first patterns were made by Loonie. It was something he wrote down when he was brainstorming for a contribution for the chiptune compo at LTP3-party back in 1999.\n\nI asked if he was OK with me releasing this tune as a coop, he said yes and here we are.\n\nWe hope someone enjoys the final tune!\nhttp://m.soundcloud.com/gusse_dsx/cracked-nostalgia",
