The idea was to create a classic arcade battle melody spiced up with a techy Disco groove. It took around half a day to compose the basic melodies and two more studio sessions with Artfx! (https://soundcloud.com/artfx) to pimp it up with a jumpy Sega bassline, self-made arcade sound effects, additional Disco percussions & an awesome mastering.\n\nThe name of the track is a reference to the computer/console game Fallout & and is especially dedicated to the legendary “RobCo Industries” corporation, one of the biggest & most influential computer and robotics corporations in the (future) United States of America. Just imagine Mr. Handy & Yes Man fighting a deadly “John Travolta style” Disco battle in front of a Nuka Cola vending machine. Makes perfect sense, huh? :)\n\nAn early beta version of the track has been released in issue #14 of the weekly Chiptune Podcast “This Week in Chiptune” by DJ Cutman (https://soundcloud.com/djcutman).\n\nHitboxx ( https://soundcloud.com/hitboxx ), a Chiptune composer from France created a cool breakbeat remix of an earlier version of the track. You can listen to his version here:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hitboxx/dualtrax-artfx-super-robco?in=dualtrax/sets/super-robco-disco-battle\n\nSuper RobCo Disco Battle was created using Renoise (http://www.renoise.com/) & Cubase (http://www.steinberg.net). The lead and some of the bass samples are from the NES & the Sega Mega Drive. The Chiptune arps have  entirely  been designed in Renoise. \n",
