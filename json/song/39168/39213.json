  "info": "I made this song during my honeymoon at Rodney Bay, Saint Lucia in the Caribbean where I married my fiancé for the past eight years, Cathrine. Who brings a laptop to their honeymoon, let alone start composing music with earplugs in the evening? I know that’s weird :) .. \nNo VSTi's .. only samples used, and it is also the first Renoise song I've finished.",
