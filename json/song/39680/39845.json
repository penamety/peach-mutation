  "info": "AMIGA 500, 4 channels, the OctaMED editor.\nRecorded from real hardware (stereo slightly changed).\nFinally I got the ACA500 interface for the Amiga (RAM, CPU, HDD/CF). Work with the device is highly comfortable and nice!! Thx to it, I plan to make a longer oldschool rave / breakbeat / house album, using the interface :) and this song will be part of it, so treat it as a teaser. ;)",
