  "info": "One of the songs from 2013 album \"Microsongs\" that you can listen and buy from here: [url]http://cheapbeatsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/microsongs[/url]\nI made it for ZX Spectrum 16K with AY-interface but of course 16K is too small ram for a reasonable tracker, so the song has been composed on ZX Spectrum 48K + AY-interface (ZX Sound Tracker 1.1).\nRecorded from real hardware.\n\nPS: The album has been released by Japan-based label CheapBeats (Tokyo).\n\nLet chiptunes/micromusic be with You!!!!!!!",
