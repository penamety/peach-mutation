  "info": "Well. It's probably an undone remix.\nIt's sounding like the original pretty 90% of the time. :)\nI didn't really changed much. After that tune i moved in my first own appartement and didn't touch it until all my project data was gone due an harddisk crash. :)\n\nI like it anyway. And i never heard something about the song for years. So i thought, maybe someone knows the original autor. [?]",
