  "info": "Im pretty sure, i named the CD Skyhigh because of that tune.\nI'm also pretty sure, that i could make it even better in some way. I had a 2nd project there with good vst plugings. But then my move and a harddisk fail made me in that way, that i have a CD with Water Theme and only Alpha remixes. :) So i touched it a little bit just for learning.",
