Only one knop.\n\n80 euro with psychological test.\n50euro without.Takes 3/4 hour.\n\nStudy is done.\n\n*puke*\n\nf-MRT is a big, very expensive Magnetresonancetormograph which is medicinally used.\n\nI did that track before the study, because i go sometimes for a money to it.\nIt has many glasfibers and is heavy loud. :-)\n\nI do not believe that there are much results with f-mrt and even with a modern Computertormograph.\n\nBut for a payed checkup it's good, because of they can see the blood flow.\n\nSo they called me.
