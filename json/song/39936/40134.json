  "info": "\nMade entirely using Ableton 6, A handful of vsti's (mainly the massive and the sylenth1), some old ragga calls I had lying about on my hard drive and the usual cut up drum loops and a fair few crates of beer and cigarettes. \n\nDone simply because its the sort of music I grew up with and its the sort of music I started out writing and always find myself drawn too and in the \"scene\" pretty much what im best known for.\n\nShouts to everyone at scene sat, remix 64, retro remakes, alex aris, ovine, retrospec, psytronik, all the spanish remakers ive worked with who's names are too numerous and well.. spanish for my pathetic english brain to remember (but they know who they are), my friends on facebook, anyone thats a fan, my twitter buddies, dan franklin, bassline junkie, anyone who has ever supported the scene, and even those that don't and my mum .. just because she's my mum. \n",
