  "info": "\nA return to Jeskola's buzz for this one, the sylenth, lounge lizard and Nexus 2 in attendance and my usual bout of cut up breakage. \n\nI went back to Buzz after having a fiddle about on it around a friends house (trying to help him to discover what music program he wanted to try out.. he opted in the end for the reaper). This came out of that session with him and took about an hour to write, But I quite liked the sound of it so decided to clean it up and throw it out here to you. \n\nShouts to everyone at scene sat, remix 64, retro remakes, alex aris, ovine, retrospec, psytronik, all the spanish remakers ive worked with who's names are too numerous and well.. spanish for my pathetic english brain to remember (but they know who they are), my friends on facebook, anyone thats a fan, my twitter buddies, dan franklin, bassline junkie, anyone who has ever supported the scene.\n",
