  "info": "I wrote this for Ray who ran Amiganuts nearly 20 years ago now which is scary. I can still remember creating the samples which strangely I can still remember where they were from. I might update this at some point with a fuller remix or something. \n\nThanks,\nJames\n\n--\n\nFor it's age, this tune rocks. Over 14 years old at time of writing, and one of the very few tunes to become the introduction of tracking to many (but not all, obviously) in the early days when this was circulated on the CU Amiga cover disks complete with Octamed 3. The Amiganuts theme certainly is kept as one of the best nostalgic pieces in my collection.\n\n-m0d",
