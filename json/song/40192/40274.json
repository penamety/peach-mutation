I'd have faded it, but the C50-C90 commands don't really allow very smooth global fading ;) If necessary, I could fix it for the musicdisk with manual CXX commands in each channel...\nThere's some use of the 4XX filter override command, but I think this is fixed in all replayers now, so that's cool. \nThanks again for a great tracker and a great port :)\n\n\"Gartantuan greets to the usuals, with extra h<3arts to xeron, spotUP and exobuzz for this amazing software and for their tireless feature implementations:D Words to d0pefish for all the hardware help and fuckings to parapete for killing the scene.\"",
