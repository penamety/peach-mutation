  "info": "Do not listen to it.\nRun if you want to live.\nRun fast!\n\nNo normal man can listen to it and remain normal - or even survive - because this is THE LOWEST LO-FI possible.\n\nOK, 1-bit fully digital music. Only 34Kb of data (samples+notes).\n1 channel, software mixing to 3ch, no volumes, no sound-card, no nothing. ;) ;) ;)\nOnly 3,5Mhz CPU and 1-bit transducer on the output.\n\nIt gives us BEEPER *.mod-like music on regular ZX Spectrum 48K. Equals: total noise.\n\nDo not listen to it from emulator. If you must - turn the trebles down. Almost to minimum. Emulator adds noise that is not present on real machine (well, it is but in a much smaller degree).\n\nComposed on SampleTracker (that allows only 16 samples and 16 patterns. I used here 8 samples and 14 patterns here).\n\nRecorded from Real Hardware for a glory of 1-bit noise.",
