  "info": "When I did this song, I put a lot of work in it. And worked with it\n  until I began to like the song in a \"musical\" way, just not the same\n  way I like songs like \"icefront.s3m\" etc. I asked a few experienced\n  musicians, and they liked it. Okey, enough... I went to the fudge'96,\n  and intended to compete with this song. I also zipped a decent player\n  with the song. And told the compo-manager, that THIS song was\n  Impulse Tracker only. \"No problem\", Maxwel. \"I know I know\", Moony.\n  AND finally the multichannel compo starts.. I notice that they use FT2\n  to play the songs. taptaptap... nice songs ... People begun to vote ...\n  Suddenly, \"You've now heard ALL the multichannel modules!\". What?\n  People finnish off their voteforms. \"Now, the 4chn\"... Argh.\n  I ask moony why my song weren't played. \"Wait a minute, there's\n  an extra multichannel, uhm nr.. 18. Okey, AFTER this song; the 4 chn!\".\n  People seems to like the song.. Some of those who vote damn seriously\n  place it 2nd. Few people attend to the song.\n\n  Okey, I won't blame anyone. But this just irritates me.\n\n  Greets&info in song. Play in Impulse Tracker, pref. 2.06\n",
