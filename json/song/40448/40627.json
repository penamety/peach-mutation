  "info": "A part of the Warped 3 musicdisk in Dec 1998, this was basically a smart alec attempt to do everything as standard as possible with a song. Verse and chorus, major to relative minor, 3 minutes long... Turned out a bit more interesting than planned. Based around a nice piano motif, simple drum & cowbell pattern, and that old digdug bass sound from the old amiga days. 4/4, 8 channels, moderate tempo, pleasant enough and a bit catchy.\n\nCheck traxinspace for more tunes.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
