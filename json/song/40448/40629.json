  "info": "Not entirely sure what to classify this piece as. Perhaps trip hop, perhaps experimental, perhaps bitpop, perhaps bent and demented.\n\nBased around a bit of a breakbeat, slowed down and whacked out... some hand drums... some bent keyboard sounds... some space cadet vocal phrases about mould growing in the salsa... misused techno sounds... a mid-section break to chiptune then back the bent theme... with an outro that's like a little musicbox gone wrong.\n\nOne of the best pieces I've ever written, and certainly among the more strange ones.\n\nReleased a single track in 2001 for the group Inflicted.\n\nCheck traxinspace for the entire disk.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
