  "info": "Written in MultiTracker, as an accompaniment to some new Stunts tracks I made with a blank terrain I also made.\n\nIt's a bit demostyle, a bit dicky, making use of some of the cheesiest samples I could possibly find. Surprisingly well structured for what I intended to just be a bit of a joke. With some breakup sections from the main theme, but not what I would call middle-8's or choruses, or even Part A and Part B.\n\nOne of the better non-chiptune bitpop tunes I've written.\n\nCheck traxinspace for more music.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
