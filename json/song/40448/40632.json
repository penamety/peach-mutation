  "info": "As chiptune as it gets. Nicely straightforward produced, very enjoyable pop chip. Very much inspired by Hunz and his Deep Fried work.\n\nJust under two minutes, a great deal improved over my earlier chiptune efforts that run a similar duration.\n\nIt has a mild swing, more of a bounce actually, that helps it along with a nice feel. Moderate-fast tempo. Most likely to be the lead track on the next vinyl LP I put out soon.\n\nCheck traxinspace for more tunes.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
