  "info": "A driving bass riff that carries the main theme throughout, this pop/funk ditty was another step up in quality for me. It was meant to be for a CD that Optix was going to put out, but as far as I know, never eventuated.\n\nThis was the first time I'd successfully written an entire song with quality sounds and good riffs/melodies that lasted more than two minutes, and also my first time of using 16 channels.\n\nI'd been listening to a lot of Necros, Basehead, Legend, Liam The Lemming and other less chippy artists at this point, so tried to do something like their styles. I think it actually was somewhat of a success, being still enjoyable to listen to now, 17 years later. Though, of course, I'm sure there is room for improvement.\n\nDefinitely one of the highlights of my early years, probably the best of all of them actually.\n\nSee traxinspace for more\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
