  "info": "Short and sweet, one of my most quirky numbers. It's not quite chiptune although it has arpeggios, it's definitely not rock although it has drums & bass guitar, and it's not quite experimental though it uses glass as a percussion instrument. It's in 7/4 time and 7/121 tempo, with plastic crackling as an intro.\n\nOne of my favourite songs that I've written, and one of the strangest.\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
