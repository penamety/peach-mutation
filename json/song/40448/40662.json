  "info": "9th in the Tacho remix series, this one features a crunchy Marshall distorted guitar playing the riff at 141bpm, with some stereo bass sounds at a couple of octaves, this is by far the best in the series. Chipleads are slightly reminiscent of the Funky Tacho chipchords in some places.\n\nUsing samples of a friend's Pearl Master Series drum kit for the rhythm, it could probably be bassier and more thumping, but I think the song holds its own pretty well as-is. Reminds me a little bit of Def FX.\n\nOriginally released 17Jun on the mod archive and s3m.com\n\nSee traxinspace for more:\nhttp://www.traxinspace.com/profile/andyabstract",
