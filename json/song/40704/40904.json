  "info": "Info from Soundcloud:\n\nHey ppl,\nHere I bring you a little chiptune track called 'Magnolia Bakery'.\nI visited NY not long ago (which was a blast btw) and while I was there I went to the Magnolia bakery on Bleecker st. This track represents that good day.\nIt's dedicated to all the chiptune fans following my page (you're awesome) and when I was composing this I was in a pure a sugar rush state. Hope it's just as sweet as the cupcakes at Magnolia bakery!\n\n/Zalza\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal .XM module: http://www.zalzamusic.com/releases/Zalza_-_Magnolia_Bakery_Module.zip\n------------------------------------------------------------",
