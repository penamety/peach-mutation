  "info": "Info from Soundcloud:\n\nHey people,\nI recently got some sweet melodies in my head. So I decided to put them to notes and hit record.\n\nThe outcome was this chip-disco track \"Window of Opportunities\" which has some adventurous crossovers. It was inspired by the new year - 2014, Sci-fi-channel UFO-documetaries and various C64-tunes.\n\nThe working name for this chiptune-ninja was something like \"soup kitchen\", but it grew into something more energetic and I threw in some more production as well.\n\nHope you enjoy this powered-up chiptune for all you bleepers in 2014! Cheers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: Turn the volume down because of the song strate.. however, the file was big as heck.",
