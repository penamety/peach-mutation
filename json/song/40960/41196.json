I was looking\nto create the same feeling that I ended up making with this song, so\nthat's a definate plus.  I hope you all get some sort of enjoyment out\nof this song.\n\nIn light of certain things, I would like to thank FM for considering me\nto be a part of their musicdisk.  My only regret is that it didn't work\nout due to things that were my fault anyway.  Thanks, guys, and I hope\nthat we can resolve things in the future.\n\n- Ari\n\nHeys go to, and in no particular order,\n\n*All* of Immortal Coil\n*All* of Analogue\n\nHunz:  werd to my new friend :)   \nDJ Tek:  your samples are the BEST.
