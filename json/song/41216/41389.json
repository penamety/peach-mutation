  "info": "eha of smash designs\n\"feeling weird\"\nevoke 2008\ntiny music competition\nwww.eha-music.de\n\nSimilar to another eha tune called \"6402\" which was \"inspired by FEEKZOID's \"Breakthrough\"\" (quoted from my copy of the 6402 xm module). The module for this song says \"evoke 2008\" so I'm assuming that the song was remixed slightly from 6402 and submitted to evoke.",
