  "info": "The song comes from my album \"Chiptunes\" (October 2014) downloadable from here: yerzmyey.i-demo.pl/\n\nAMIGA 500 (8 channels).\nMade with OctaMED.\nRequires 1Mb of ChipRam.\nRecorded from real hardware. (Stereo slightly changed).\n\nYesssssssss. After 20 years I made an 8-channels module on Amiga500 AGAIN. ;) I wasn't sure how it would work, as once can't actually use volumes in this mode, on OctaMED. It's because there is only 4 volumes for 8 traxx then. Which suxx. So it's better not to use volumes at all and make more 'version' of samples, with various volumes.\nAlso the sound-quality gets much lower in the 8ch mode. But whatta hell - why not to force old good A500 to some harder work (software mixing: actually two chips play the music: Paula but also Motorola :) ).\n\nEnjoy this small experiment. ;)\n",
