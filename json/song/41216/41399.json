  "info": "A MIDI song composed for Wild Compo of SillyVenture 2014 Atari Party.\n\nThis is kind of micromusic I made in MIDI standard, using two machines from 80s:\n\n- a sound-module Roland MT-32 (8 channels + drums) - 1987\n- ATARI 520ST (with Cubase 2.1 as the sequencer) - 1985\n\nI don't have any opportunity to play live some improvisations when I use trackers, so this time - with MIDI - it was kind of fun. :)\n\nAlso I think people tend to forget the MIDI is Atari's power, so I just wanted to remind it. ;)\n\nEnjoy.\nYerz",
