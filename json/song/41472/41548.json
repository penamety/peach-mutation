This has\n    to  be one of  the most  moving pieces I  (Lemm) have  ever had the\n    pleasure of working on.\n\n    Jakob  (that's  Radix,  for those  of you who  haven't been  paying\n    attention ;) ) gave me a helluva start off on this one. Most of the\n    structure was laid out already;  all I had to do  was tie it up and\n    finish it off. According to Jakob, I've done a good job on it.\n\n    Now THAT'S a compliment. =)\n\n    Greets must go out, of course,  to everyone in Analogue and Process\n    Five, our respective groups.\n\n    LEMM also greets:\n      All the NAID 96 loonies... I *still* miss those days.\n      The regular #trax crowd.  Thanks for rescuing me from countless\n        nights of tiresome study. ;)\n      EagleFalcon, for his tireless support and encouragement.\n      The  ragtag band of madcap  crackheads that is the  Kosmic Free\n        Music Foundation. :)\n      Welti, for supplying me with numerous fresh samples when I most\n        needed them. =)\n",
