  "info": "I'm so psyched to present my brand new chiptune track called \"Douchebag Rumble\", which is the first single from my upcoming album Superposition.\n\nThe album is set to be released in late January (or early February), including many never before released tracks as \"Chasing The Clouds\", \"Ms. Bed Burrito\", \"The Lonesome Droid\" and more.\n\nNow it's officially xmas and I hope you're all having great 8-bit holiday. As it is xmas and all I've decided to give you this download for free!\n\nHope you like it and please don't act like a douche on xmas :)\n\nComments and shares are welcome, cheers\n/Zalza\n\nArtwork: (c) Emilia Forrest 2014",
