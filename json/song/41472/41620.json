  "info": "Ranked #6 place in the Music Contest 6 (veteran division). \n[url=https://hornet.org/ha/pages/mc6/results_2/veteran/m6v-spop.html]MC6 ratings on this track! :D[/url]\n\nSimple yet tracked one, but I loved it. The melodies are nice, you might expect it out of tune a bit.. however it's good imho.\n\nNote: The final version of this track is longer than this one, so this uploaded one here is shortened for the compo. :P",
