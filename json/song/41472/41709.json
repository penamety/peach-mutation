Whether it be a rose or\n\n a weed is up to us.\"\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWell, thanks for the coffee *again* ArtIce.\n\nAnd thanks Jeffrey Lim for the\n best tracker on the planet ;)\n\n___________________________________________\nComments? Questions? Howz the song anyway?\n\nI'm at  zastar@uclink4.berkeley.edu\n     Warining: I answer ;)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\n(Press Down/PgDn to see more)\n\nThis song requires quite a powerful computer to play it (because it gets\nto 44 channels) unless you have a Gravis UltraSound. If your computer\ncan't handle this, then you will need to play around with the command line\nswitches.\n\n /Lxx will limit the number of channels that can be allocated. \n /Mxxxxx will set the 'mixing' speed to use.\n\nExample: IT /L32 will limit the program to 32-note polyphony (still more\nthan some MIDI soundcards)\n\nThe mixing speed is the number of calculations per second that the program\nhas to make for each note. If you have a SB16, the default is 44kHz (ie.\n44 THOUSAND calculations per second per note playing.) Reducing the mixing\nspeed reduces the quality of the sound, but increases the number of\nchannels that you can play.\n\nExample: IT /M32000 will set the mixing speed to 32000 calculations per\nsecond.\n\nOf course, you can combine these as such:\n\nIT /M32000 /L16\n\nThe final commandline switch worth knowing is /R which reverses left and\nright output channels.\n\n                                                     - Jeffrey Lim\n                                                       Pulse/PoP",
