  "info": "I decided to compose a remix of the Demo Tune 10 as it seems to named :) It's one tune of the The Deadline demo ( 2nd part music) released by Finnish Gold.\nThis is my first touch for C-64 music since 1990, so I've been out the scene 25 years:) time flies....\nI played quitar and bass lines and for drums used Ez Drummer. Original C-64\n lines are spiced with some effects like Reverb, Delay, Wah and Chorus.\nEnjoy and feel free to comment!\nCheers!\n",
