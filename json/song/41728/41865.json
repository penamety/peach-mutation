  "info": "My entry for the Tracked music competition at Revision 2015 made with MilkyTracker.\n\nMy aim was to make this sound like a playful jam session (hence the name Marmelade (Jam). I spent quite some time working on this song, starting in february, and finishing it at Revision. My XM skills are a little bit rusty (first XM i finish for many years).",
