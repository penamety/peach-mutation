  "info": "\"The song from Adapt's demo Deeper Focus at Revision 2015. Unfortunately the demo didn't end up in the top three. I tried to mix genres so confusingly so it would be uncategorizable (Turkish, Egyptian, Indian, dub, metal etc), but some anorak categorized this as maqsoum based on the rhythm.\"",
