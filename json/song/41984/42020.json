  "info": "Ranked 13# place on Music Contest 6 at the intermediate division. \n\nAn orchestral ballad that has a kinda Castlevania vibe (it comes to my mind to think in which it reminds me of) to it, it might get boring at times.. however, it's quite well done though. Well, the only problems here is the low quality of samples and lack of harmony.",
