  "info": "A tune about a girl named Bilgi, I thought she was pretty with long black curly hair. So, a nice title for this track. At the beginning it was much longer. I was so happy with the result that I had multiplied the same patterns several times. But I realized that more concise would be much better. And then I imagined some transitions and breaks to shorten it and go to the essential. Here, sounds are still quite chip but in my compositions I have always tried to use sounds better to give an atmosphere less computer. It was almost an obsession because most people who listened to my tracks told me that. Now we try rather to go sounds very chip, it's funny reversal of this situation, right?",
