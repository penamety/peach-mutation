  "info": "It's a J-POP chiptune I made in 2014 - it is a cover of the main-title music from Sailor Moon Stars anime TV-series. :)\n\nI prepared it especially for my concert in Tokyo/Japan, in 2014 (the Square Sounds Tokyo chiptune festival).\n\nThis particular song has been designed for a ZX Spectrum with TurboSound interface (2 x AY chip = 6 channels).\n\nAs I use only the standard ZX SoundTracker 1.1 editor (the oldest tracker for Spectrum, released in 1991 or 1992) - and it uses only 3 channels - I had to make _separately_ two \"halves\" of the song :) NOT hearing them both at once, hehehe. I had to... 'imagine' one while making another. :)\n\nOnly when I finished the song, I merged both the halves together and then I was able to play entire song (and record) from my Speccy2010 comp - and it was the first time I actually heard my tune, hehehe.\n\nAnyway, it took me something like a month (or more) to make the cover: I love the song but it isn't the easiest to do. ;)\n\nEnjoy! ;)\n",
