  "info": "From the author :\n[quote]Finished it on Amiga Day as well, apparently. Appropriate, seeing as it's a remix of the Amiga classic \"Xenon\" - a stompin' bit of high-energy game music which I've transformed into some all-over-the-place madness. It was produced in Reason 7 and Ableton, and I named it \"Xoldin' Out for a Xero\" in tribute to the classic Bonnie Tyler song of almost the same name (from which I took thunderclap inspiration).\n\nEnjoy![/quote]\n\nMore info & download :\n[url=http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR03181]ReMix: Xenon 'Xoldin' Out for a Xero' - OverClocked ReMix[/url]\n[url=http://www.remix64.com/track/binster/xenon-xoldin-out-for-a-xero-remix/]Remix64 - Xenon (Xoldin' Out For A Xero Remix, Amiga Remix by Binster)[/url]",
