  "info": "I originally had plans for another tune to submit to this compilation, but that didn't quite work out.\nA few weeks ago a swedish band called 'Shallow Sense' posted four songs they wanted to have remixed.\nI then started playing around with the samples of one of those tracks, and pretty much in two-three days I made this.\n\nThe choirs are actually done using samples. A friend of mine; Slaygon, recorded about two octaves of \"aaaaaaaa\".\nI then edited his recordings and made them into a DirectWave preset. Then I copied about ten instances of it, and transposed each of them one note up.\nThis way, the choir sounds very \"full\" and nice. Initally, the goal was to make it sound like 10cc's choirs in their track \"I'm not in love\".\n\nThe acoustic guitar in the second half of the song were downloaded from a website with random guitar-samples. I changed the chords using Melodyne.\nThe vocals were also quite tweaked, along with the other guitar-samples.\n\nIn total I spent 12 hours in FL Studio and Melodyne.\nI do think it has it's flaws, but hopefully someone will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!",
