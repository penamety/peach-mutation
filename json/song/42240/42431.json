  "info": "Well, this one is dear to me... did a mix of this a long time ago in FT2, and now i did it again in Propellerheads Reason.\nBasically, what i've done with this remix is that i've stripped away all the stuff i didn't like in the original tune, and instead put in a little more emphasis on the stuff i liked with it. I'm a big fan of house music, so i made a nice little latino/salsa type rythm and added some nice bassdrum and bassline to the mix and to top it off, a nice south american style flute-ish sound for the lead.\nEnjoy.\n/Richard Bernstr√∂m a.k.a.
