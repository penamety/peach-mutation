  "info": "This is a piece of music with only guitars, but the samples available to me at the time were not very similar. Here, no guitar solo of hell, or amazing powerful riffs, just a tune a bit repetitive. There is a vibrato effect on the main channel that I have done by putting the volume to zero every two lines. The drums and the bassline are particularly successful, in my opinion. Finally, listening to the result, the title is quite right, something that goes fast. ",
