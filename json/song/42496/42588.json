  "info": "A Direction\nBy El Blanco\nof\nKombo/Chaos Theory/3STF\n for Kombo\n\nabout 4:23min\n\nThis was my BMP compo II entry this year. What a huge compo! 500+ entries. Man and I thought the MC's where big. No wonder the results are taking so long to get back. As of this point I still don't know what place(s) I got (I entered 2 songs as per the rules). But it's the competition that counts in the end not the ranking. I'm pretty new to the techno/electronica genre and am still learning what song is what style etc. and how I should make the songs sound. But hey, you gotta give me credit for entering :)\n\nI really don't know where most of the samples came from. The ones I do I put the credits in the sample text.",
