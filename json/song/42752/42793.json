  "info": "When the new Audacious Audio Player was upgraded and the Software missed the 'J' Key for searching through the Song Library and i thought it is a Computer error and rebootet. I decided, to use Windows 7 for a few Minutes. Soon i found a Project File from 2008, changed it a bit and later added some C64 MSSIAH sounds. The corpus of it is like i want it to have. But as in most of such Music i make, I'm sick & tired at the end, from having a Windows 7 experience.\n\nDon't advice any other Microsoft Product to me. I won't use it. [long] \nAnd Thanks for the [Fish] :-)\n\n-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rng_sUJbphk",
