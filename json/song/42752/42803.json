  "info": "Made' my first TECHNO track with SEQ24 we covered in Version 0.9.3 from removal in Gentoo's tree! It is a bit noisy. But a MIX with the SIDStation 6581 is very hard like a violine, it changes the shape of sound every few seconds. So you have to take care of a bunch of tasks while adding notes to SEQ24. controlling the 8580 is not so hard. Well, I was a bit without idea at the end. \n\n[b]---> The Fox Arrives Home. <---[/b]\n\n[url]http://music.it-flash.de/space-den-of-a-fox_v.1.0_.mp3[/url]",
