  "info": "Made' my first TECHNO track with SEQ24 we covered in Version 0.9.3 from removal in Gentoo's tree! It is a bit noisy. But a MIX with the SIDStation 6581 is very hard like a violine, it changes the shape of sound every few seconds. So you have to take care of a bunch of tasks while adding notes to SEQ24. controlling the 8580 is not so hard. Well, I was a bit without idea at the end.\n\n[b] ---> The Fox Arrives Home. <---[/b]\n\n[big]I now have worked on the \"Song Volume -18dB Decay 20\", Sample Volume Automation and after all, i took a *.WAV directly vom the Master instead recording it through much cables. Damn..At first I thoght I have not enough Memory at the Master to record another big *.wav ; - O - Overally, this is a Test with some Automation! SEQ24 and four midi devices! [/big]\n\n[quote]Comparison complete. ; - ) That file isn't so much distorted... Can someone delete the v.1.0?[/quote] \n\n[url]http://music.it-flash.de/space-den-of-a-fox_v.1.5-fixed_.mp3[/url]",
