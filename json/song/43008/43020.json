  "info": "A 'funk' chiptune with a slow intro. Made in 2016. ZX Spectrum 48K with AY-interface was my instrument here.\nSome complex synthesis has been used to avoid the usual boring square-wave of AY. The problem with those advanced synths is - literally all notes have to be tuned manually to a proper key/pitch. So You can imagine it's kind of tedious. ;)",
