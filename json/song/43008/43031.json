Doesn't matter. We gonna help you. Uh-huh.]\n\nCall 1-800-DEMOSCENE, in between, and you'll get lucky.\nWhat can we say we love 4k C++, and salmiakki.\n\nCall 1-800-DEMOSCENE, in between, and you'll get lucky.\nWhat can we say we love 4k C++, and salmiakki.\n\nYou can't concentrate so you walk outside for a drink or three by the fireplace you meet Abductee.\nThe bonfire gets hotta.\nYou pass out from vodka.\nWhere is everyone to get the entry done.\n\n[It don't matta. We gonna make your day. Uh-uh uh-uh.]\n\nCall 1-800-DEMOSCENE, in between, and you'll get lucky. (ohhhh)\nWhat can we say we love 4k C++, and mystic Okkie.\n\nCall 1-800-DEMOSCENE, in between, and you'll get lucky. (ohh ohhh oh ohhh)\n\nWe'll fix your file Amiga style (C++), and we got Okkie. (ohh ohhh oh ohhh)\n\n[You don't need to be dealing with this shit alone. Ain't nobody got time for dat.]\n\nYou said you would rock the compo with your funky crew.\nNow your code and shaders are overdue.\nThe deadline's coming closer you feel like a poser and you have no clue how to pull it through.\n\n[[It's always been time to call us but sure as hell it is now.]]\n\nYou got your entry finished and entered after all.\nNow you wander mindlessly around the hall.\nBut then there's an announcement your entry has bounced and Evilbot has replied: YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED.\n\n[[Oh come on now you have to call us right?]]\n\nCall 1-800-DEMOSCENE, in between, and you'll get lucky. (Lucky, lucky, lucky)\n\n[Ain't nobody got time for dat.]\n\nWhat can we say we love 4k C++, and salmiakki. (yakki, yakki)\n\nCall 1-800-DEMOSCENE, in between, and you'll get lucky.\nWe are you muses. (muses, muses)\n\nItsy bitsy teeny weeny ddt in a minikini.\nWe've heard, enough excuses.\n\n[You don't need to be dealing with this shit alone. We're in this together.]\n\n(Ahhhhh, ahhhhh)\n\n[We're in this together.]\n\n[[Call 1-800-DEMOSCENE]]\n\n[[Call 1-800-DEMOSCENE]]\n\n[[[We're sorry the number you have dialed is not in service.
