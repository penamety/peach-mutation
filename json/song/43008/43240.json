  "info": "\"Mm, just like lying in the grass somewhere around the Cretaceous period, this is very much a Sunday four million years ago song from our man in SF Prob. Well, ok, it goes a little disquietingly snare-rushed later, but that's just the flocks of pterodactyls swooping overhead.. they won't bother you. Don your shades and enjoy the sunshine.. only 600,000 years 'til that asteroid lands, no hurry.\"\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/rel22",
