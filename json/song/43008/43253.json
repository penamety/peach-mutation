  "info": "9th at Solskogen 2016 Newschool music compo\n\n---\n\nThanks to Modulo One for the countless hours spent helping me progress the song, figuring out a melody that is possible to sing and for the actual singing. Yes, that is his lush and hypnotic voice you're hearing. All natural. \n\nThanks to my sister for providing backing vocals on extremely short notice. Thinking about it, giving myself effectively a week to produce the entire song from scratch was not such a good idea. But here it is, as done as it's going to get before submission to Solskogen 2016's Newschool Music Competition.\n\nAlso, Tom Andr√© needs mention for playing the piano in the intro of the song. He's truly a great piano player.\n\nThanks to my wonderful wife for putting up with my hobby and enduring the late nights I've had to spend to finish this song.\n\nShout-outs to Miu for endless amounts of production tips and tricks.",
