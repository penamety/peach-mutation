  "info": "Original Song Info (sans contact info):\n\nTo Reach Quests' End for MODs Anthology CD\n\nSample Credits:\n\nPurple Motion\nSkaven\nNecros\nKrystall\nMarkell Moss\nOthers (Tambourine and Snare)\nGravis UltraSound\n\nThis song was originally an S3M written for a diskmag that was finally\nreleased about 6 months after it's original deadline! (That wasn't my\nfault :) ) It was also part of Epinicion's BLT musicdisk (still in S3M\nformat) - I converted it to .IT for this CD, modifying very little\n(just to take a little advantage of the instrument options) and I shoved\nin a 16-bit version of the strings. It's almost identical to the original\nfile (ie. it doesn't *really* use volume envelopes or NNAs, which could\nhave made this so much easier (quicker) to write).\n\nThe time changes in this piece may make the rhythm *SEEM* stuffed when you\nwatch the pattern data...\n\nMake sure you listen to at least order 10! That's when the real music\nstarts.\n\nHope you like this!",
