  "info": "The Megasong Project\n====================\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Megasong Project is a demoscene music project initiated by Fabian Del Priore aka Rapture to bring together talented demoscene musicians and trackers from all over the world, combining their forces in one big music piece, which they bring together in collaboration; each participant is working on a part of the song (each one working on a few patterns or so), before it's the turn of the next participant and the tune is handed to him. The end result is a massive coop tune, but sounding as homogeneous and consistent as possible.\n\nThe first Megasong is made in Spacesynth (think Laserdance/Koto) style, but thinkable for the future are all kinds of styles with all kinds of different musicians, a different song length, different software to work with and so on and on, so the whole project is flexible to the max!\n\nI would define and imagine the Megasong stating the following basic features:\n\nStyle: Whatever the given group of musicians can agree on, everything is possible: Chipmusic, Demomusic, Gamemusic, Soundtracker ST-01 / Earlymod, Techno, Trance, German folk musik, experimental, whatever... Mainthing is working together on a FUN project! :D\n\nLength: Minimum 10 minutes, maximum 30 minutes\nNumber of participants: Minimum 5 participants, maximum: Open end, but we shouldn't exaggerate here or else organising it will be complicated. ;)\nPlatform/Software: Depends. Could be anything from any tracker to any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation / music studio environment) like Steinberg Cubase. The music group must have roughly the same experience on the same platform. For DAW's like Renoise or Cubase, only freeware VST Plugins will be used (no commercial plugins) and exchanged between the group, so that every composer can take part on the project without any hassle!\n\nFor the first Megasong project, the following talented demo scene musicians could be engaged:\n\n- Elrinth (Nicklas Holmgren)\n- Rage (Harri Blom)\n- Rapture (Fabian Del Priore)\n- Serpent (Touko VÃ¤re)\n- Shinobi aka Triton (Marcus Andre Rousseau)\n- Silok (Robert Katsenos)\n- Spiral (Mats Antonsson)\n\n\nEvery demo scene musican feeling talented and motivated enough is invited for exciting future Megasong projects! :)\n\nHave fun listening and drop us a comment!
