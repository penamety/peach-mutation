  "info": "Move! Bitbear's music entry for the demoscene party Solskogen 2015's Newschool Music Competition. \n\nThe first sketch of the song was started many years ago and then placed in hibernation until the night of Thursday 8th of July, where I finally had some time to attempt doing a track for Solskogen's Newschool Music Competition. \n\nI brute forced myself through the night and produce an arrangement-wise complete song that I delivered at the party the 10th of July, but it was full of bugs so the mix sounded awful. Thus, I've reworked large parts of it so it sounds like this. Hope you like it!",
