  "info": "Lyrics: \n\nA lonely warm mid-August night, on the streets of old downtown,\nI'm watching the red-green neon lights and get lost inside the sound.\nBut I just want to take you in my arms and go dance the night away,\nso I follow the masses and drink lots of glasses and forget about today.\n\nRefrain:\n\nIt is just Party Night under the pale moon light,\nit is just Party Night and I keep on searching for you.\nIt is still Party Night under the electric light,\nit is still Party Night and I got to spend it with you.\n\nI'm walking slowly thru traffic lights and the smell of gasoline,\nI'm travelling, I'm circling subway lines to stations I've never been.\nBut I just want to keep you in my heart for the rest of all my days,\nso I follow the cars along the great boulevards and go blow my mind away!\n\n8) Yeah baby, I got to find you, on the streets of this lonely town.\nSomehow, some way, I'll get to you, tonight! 8)\n\nRefrain:\n\nIt is just Party Night under the pale moon light,\nit is just Party Night and I keep on searching for you.\nIt is still Party Night under the electric light,\nit is still Party Night and I got to spend it with you.\n\nI remember the special evening I saw your face the last time (the last time).\nYour eyes were flashing like strobo lights and love was in your smile (in your smile).\nBut I just couldn't stay, I ran away, there were other things to do (other things to do).\nFew minutes later I felt the pain inside, I couldn't sleep because of you, because of you!",
