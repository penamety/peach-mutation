  "info": "The musical suite composed for Bejeweled 2, a sequel to the popular PopCap game. The music is also a sequel to the original Network (which you can find below). 40 minutes of 80's style synth-ambient music. Contains multiple parts. Note: the track is long, so the MP3 / OGG downloads are huge. Copyright PopCap Games. Do not use in other productions.\n",
