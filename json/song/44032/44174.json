Done before August 1989 but the exact date is not known.\n\n[code]switch are proud to \t\npresent their latest \t\ninvention # synthetic \t\nwaveforms for st # \t\nwe hope that you like \t\nit and besides that \t\nthat you enjoy it. \t\nfor that's the main \t\nreason why we make \t\nmusic. the (samples) \t\nfound in this song \t\nwere mostly distilled \t\nfrom public sources \t\nso please don't rip \t\nthem yourselves you \t\nmostlikely already \t\nkeep them in your own \t\nprivate (messed-up) \t\nsample lib's (plst's) \nwe always enjoy \t\nlooking into your \t\nplst's (from the st- \t\ncompacts that we get) \t\nand are amused by \t\nthe names that you \nbaptize your samples \t\nwith. we even saw the \t\nsamples that we used \t\nfor paranoimia. but \t\nthen again who cares. \t\nwe don't expect reply[/code]",
