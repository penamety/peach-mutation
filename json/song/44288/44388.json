  "info": "\"Learning can be a breeze.. Ain't cool to be a fool!\"\n\nFrom the (never released) album \"A Little Nach Music\". Published June 2002.\n\nDownload link:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070211052111/http://virt.vgmix.com:80/music/nach/mc_nachbar_-_gettin'_a's_just_to_show_the_g's.mp3\n\nYeah, I know better than anybody else how it be.\nNobody else got the lyrical mastery like me.\nThrow my flows down seven days a week.\nMC Nach got the power that ya all like to see.\nCan't deny school can be a huge drag:\nClasses all day make you feel like jet-lag.\nGot [some?] bidness that you gotta take of.\nAin't no time fo' school that you're aware of.\nWanna live big, ain't nothing in the game:\nA scholar and a G be one and the same.\nGet your nice pad, a job that really pays.\nWanna flip burgers for the rest of yo' days?\nThought so. Now I ain't your 'rents\nBut I'm finna give it straight 'cause they got some common sense\nSo pay attention, study, tap the fountain:\nYou'll develop the intellect to bust mountains.\nEvery day gotta get learned so you can kick it.\nLater on in life, education be the ticket.\nThink it's cool tippin' outta class to do some?\nUh-uh, dumb ain't chillin': dumb just dumb.\n\nLearning can be a breeze.\nAin't cool to be a fool.\nGettin' As just to show the Gs,\nWe put the cool in school.\n\nI'm serious: ain't no shame acing classes.\nWanna be separated from all the teeming masses,\nTo raise up and get out of minimum wage? (Bling!)\nIgnorance ain't nothing but a cage.\nY'all be lovin' on your fellow man.\nUnited Way makes you show that you can.\nLook it up: hundred percent of all of your goals.\nGood Will G gotta play all the roles.\nOne to the two to the three ...???\nOne's enough ...???... gotta play ...???\nDon't let yourself take the Fs and the Ds.\nReport card gotta say A-B-Cs.\nE-drop in science like Henderson.\nKnowledge is the medicine; gotta get your credits in\nfor the project, the masterful science project.\nHeat should be the focus, and a big object.\nI'm a true love dawg so I hate to preach\nBut you all gotta listen what the teachers teach.\nY'all can't listen if you're absent every day\nUnless you [really bug him?], then go anyway.\n\nLearning can be a breeze...\n\nMidterms! Aw, snap, I hate those.\nSometimes I think I'd be happy with zeros.\nAfter all, it's a big round number\nBut I ain't happy being smart as a cucumber.\nScience, math, history and English...\nI can't think of anything that rhymes with English.\nMaybe if y'all paid attention all the time\nIt wouldn't be so hard to come up with the rhyme.\nWritten word, that's a big thing,\nGotta ...???... good with the writing\n'Cause you take it afterwards, and you got it to show\nIn your P-O-R-T-folio.\nAnother thing: gotta keep reading every week.\nFive books sayin' that your mind's staying asleep\n??? in shape, you gotta keep the books right.\nMight be boring, but later it'll be tight.\nThe key to knowledge is keepin' it real.\nNow that you've heard my lyrical appeal\nGo forth, prosper, study for your fame,\nHelp keep your mind at the top of the game.\n\nLearning can be a breeze...\n",
