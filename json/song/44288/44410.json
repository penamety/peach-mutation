  "info": "The song has been made and recorded from Raspberry Pi 2. I wanted to check out how would SID emulation work from the Broadcom BCM2836 chip (11 bit quality from a digital PWM module - gives a 'pulse width modulated' signal - working with frequency around 40MHz and it is low-pass-filtered).\nI started the song in 2015 but finished it only in March 2016.",
