  "info": "Soundtrack from \"7up\" (Seven up) demo by Speedway, was released at Paradox'99 demo party.\n2nd place in Demo Competition.\n\nSo, this demo was my last work on ZX-Spectrum. Maybe it has not so good design and has a lot of video, but there are a lot of experience in coding and a lot of greate tricks.\nThis demo was made for PDX99 and takes me about 6 month, that was really greate to do that.\nAll dudes who know Speccy and C64 understand me... And it was very pity to go to another platform, like Amiga for someone and PC for me. Thank a lot to Speecy, you will be alive in my heart forever.\n\n[i][b]-=AND=-[/b][/i]",
