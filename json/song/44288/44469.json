  "info": "If you are familiar with the demoscene (especially on the PC side during the 90s) you have probably heard this tune a thousand times because of its awesomeness.\n\nI decided to try recreating it in Logic Pro X with some soft synths. Enjoy!\n\nCredits:\n\nThe original tune was composed by Jugi Kaartinen and was released in the demo \"Dope\" by Complex at TG95.",
