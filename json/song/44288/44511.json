  "info": "BeeZerk - Someday based on the Original SID \"Someday\" by Ryan Weekes (Replay) 1992 I was listening thru the High Voltage SID Collection and found that lovely SID named \"Someday\" by Ryan Weekes (Replay). Instant love. With it's vibe, melody and charm it let me remember all the good things happening in life. A very Joyful and happy tune. That's why i had to do a Remix. For me one of those rare tunes i could listening all day long and never get tired of it. Hope you enjoy. Have Phun!",
