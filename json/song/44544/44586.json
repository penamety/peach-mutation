It flows nicely, and from start to finish it has a nice steady beat and neat acid samples. It does get repetative though, throughout much of the song. The samples are great, especially those acid ones that play nicely in the background and add to the feel of the song. The song also has some nice effects applied loosely so not to distract the listeners.\"",
