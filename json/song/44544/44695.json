  "info": "Lizard wrote to JCH: \"Do you remember if you made it originally or if I did? Or did we both rip off someone else/commercial tune? I bought the kawai k4 1988 so this was one of my first songs on amiga.\"\n\nJCH replied: \"Actually it was MSK who came to me with a short template barely consisting of the bassline and the drums in the first part of the song. I added all the chords, leaders, solos, expanded the bass in the later sections, etc. But MSK had a knack of \"borrowing\" stuff from his favorite musicians (especially George Michael) so I wouldn't be surprised if the bassline is not original at all.\"",
