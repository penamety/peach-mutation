Oh come on! What?!\n\nHi Kanga, you can’t do that\nThat’s blasphemy and profanity at once\nThey’re gonna hate you… and us.\n\nProfanity, Blasphemy\nHypocritically, Bigotry\nAll kinds of secuality\nMay be found here at\nEaster Party\n\nShader-coding, hugs for free\nLiverty, no british tea\nIt’s all about humanity\nEnjoy your life at\nEaster Party\n\nEnjoy your life\nEaster Party\nEaster Party\n\nIf you don’t know where to pee\nJust take the tunnel. Destiny\nAnd after that\nCoffee for free\nAt Easter Party\n\nAmiga, Amstrad CPC\nCommodore and Atari\nAnd systems you have never seen\nThat’s demoscene\nEaster Party\n\nJesus died for us to party\nJesus died for us to party\nEnjoy your life at\nEaster Party\n\nJesus died for us to party\nDemoscene\nEaster Party\n\nJesus loves the CPC\nHe is a great 3 inch DJ\n\nGod invented Amiga\nBut i have no Workbench-Disc to run\nHe did the Atari\nBut without a TOS-Disc there’s no fun\nHe created the Amstrad\nAnd everything works as i expect\nGod does love the Amstrad\nA system he still does not regret\n\nWhat about you? What about me?\nI do believe in Easter Party\nThe demoscene God is a good God for me\nSo shout out loud:\nEaster Party\n\nThis is for all of the CPC-scene\nOctoate, the frenchies and BSC\nThe greek Amstrad geeks are still a bit weird\nBut God is greek\nSo that’s good for me\n",
