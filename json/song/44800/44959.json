  "info": "Megasong 3: Next Destination\n============================\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Megasong Project is a demoscene music project initiated by Fabian Del Priore aka Rapture to bring together talented demoscene musicians and trackers from all over the world, combining their forces in one big music piece, which they bring together in collaboration; each participant is working on a part of the song (each one working on a few patterns or so), before it's the turn of the next participant and the tune is handed to him. The end result is a massive coop tune, but sounding as homogeneous and consistent as possible.\n\nThe third Megasong is made in Synthwave style with a spacey theme (a bit like Laserdance/Koto), but thinkable for the future are all kinds of styles with different musicians, different song length, different software to work with and so on, so the whole project is flexible to the max!\n\nIn general, I would define the Megasong stating the following basic features:\n\nStyle: Whatever the given group of musicians can agree on, everything is possible: Chipmusic, Demomusic, Gamemusic, Soundtracker ST-01 / Earlymod, Techno, Trance, German folk musik, experimental, whatever... Mainthing is working together on a FUN project! :)\n\nLength: Minimum 10 minutes, maximum 30 minutes\n\nNumber of participants: Minimum 5 participants, maximum: Open end, but we shouldn't exaggerate here or else organising it will be complicated. ;)\n\nPlatform/Software: Depends. Could be anything from any tracker to any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation / music studio environment) like Steinberg Cubase or Renoise. The music group must have roughly the same experience on the same platform. For DAW's like Renoise or Cubase, only freeware VST Plugins will be used (no commercial plugins) so they can be exchanged between the group, thus every composer of the group can take part on the project without any hassle!\n\nFor the third Megasong project, the following talented demo scene musicians could be engaged:\n\n- Elrinth (Nicklas Holmgren)\n- Rapture (Fabian Del Priore)\n- Serpent (Touko VÃ¤re)\n- Shinobi aka Triton (Marcus Andre Rousseau)\n- Silok (Robert Katsenos)\n- Spiral (Mats Antonsson)\n\nEvery demo scene musican who feels talented and motivated enough is invited for exciting future Megasong projects! Send me your ideas and some music snippets! :)\n\nHave fun listening and drop me a comment! You can reach us on the Nectarine Demoscene Radio: www.scenemusic.net :)\n\nCheers,\nRapture\n\n--\n\nDetails & specs on Megasong 3:\n\nSong Name - Megasong 3: Next Destination\n\nDAW/Tracker used - Renoise 2.8.0 x64\nStyle - Synthwave/Spacesynth\nNumber of participants - 6\nLength - 14:57\n\n--\n\nStructure of Song:\n\nRapture - 0:00 - 1:32\nSilok - 1:33 - 3:43\nRapture - 3:44 - 4:40\nShinobi - 4:40 - 7:43\nSerpent - 7:44 - 9:46\nSpiral - 9:47 - 11:57\nElrinth - 11:57 - 13:58\nRapture - 13:59 - 14:55\n\n* Lyrics from the vocoders part by Spiral:\n\nShinobi part Vocoders:\n\nLeaving Earth, in our spaceship!\nDestination unknown\n\nYou and I\nWe leave together now\nDestination unknown\n\nSpiral part Vocoders:\n\nYou and I\nAmong the stars\nOn our way\nTo a galaxy far\n\nPlanets go by\nFlying through space\nTo a new World\nTo our new home\n\nElrinth part vocoders:\n\nLanding on our new\nHome\nTonight\n:Among the new stars:\n\nWe've reached our new goal\nAmong the\nNew stars tonight",
