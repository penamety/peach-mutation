  "info": "[i]This tune started out in a hotel room on a laptop, which meant working with software synths only. It remained largely unchanged after the stay. I used a synth called \"Zebra 2\" for mostly everything. Percussion samples are ripped from various drum-machines, sprinkled with the sound of metal cans being thrown into a metal container. Arranged in Reaper.[/i]",
