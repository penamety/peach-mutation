  "info": "[i]A cynical stab at the 80's retro music market. Whole project took about two weeks from start to finish, one of which was after the SOS4 deadline. Drums sampled and sliced from Aretha Franklin - Every Girl (Wants My Guy). Background vocals by Lea. The electric guitar is an Epiphone Les Paul. Acoustic guitar is a Washburn. Bass guitar is a Fender Jazz Bass. Most of the percussive effects are recorded in my garage, clashing various objects together. Toms are sampled from various drum machines. Arranged and mixed in Reaper.[/i]",
