  "info": "[i]Hola, listener! This track was born as a wip-track that Mordi had laying around, so with only a month to add my hooks to the track, I hoped it was a quick job. It never is, is it? Mordi being a Reaper-user and Hansee still a tracker in Renoise, the fastest way was to work with stems. That soon became a problem when I wanted to change a few chords, so Mordi got back to the project, added a few more wonderful melodies and sent the midi. Now almost nothing was left of the original track and the new stuff did not quite fit anymore. Eventually we got it done with the &laquo;usual&raquo; style from Mordi and Hansee. Hope you like it! Peace out &hellip; Hansee & Mordi[/i]",
