  "info": "[i]I *love* Japanese fusion of the eighties. Think about DX7 basses and electric pianos, OBX drums, Prophet 5 poly chords and A TON of modulated reverb; artists like Toshiki Kadomatsu, Tatsuro Yamashita, Yuji Toriyama, etc. Album covers with cell shaded palm trees, blue skies, infinite coast lines, impossibly thin guitarists longing for their \"natsu\" vacation. In a word, A E S T H E T I C S. I tried to recreate some of that vibe with my not-very-eighties MacBook Pro, Studio One and all soft synths and virtual instruments. No hardware has been harmed in the making of this song :)[/i]\n",
