  "info": "[i]This time I tried to blend most of my music influences in an original concoction: a bit of Synthwave, a bit of Jarre, a bit of SID, a bit of Amiga, sprinkled with hefty doses of Italian Baroque melodies. Here it comes Gyruss Death Waltz: I envisioned astronauts landing on a planet that happens to be alive (and hungry) and starts tearing them apart in a sort of deadly, cruel dance. Others may imagine a robotic version of Rond√≤ Veneziano playing inside a futuristic palace with endless printed circuit corridors hovering on a huge motherboard/city... well, whatever this evokes for you, just N-Joy listening![/i]",
