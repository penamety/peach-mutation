  "info": "[i]Hi guys, Rapture speaking again. Yay, my 5th music contribution to the awesome Sound of SceneSat Vol. 4! Am I a busy bee or what! :D This is a coop tune which I did together with my long-time friend and colleague Chris Hülsbeck. Chris did all the base of the tune, while I added the melodies, FX and additional chord work, plus I extended the tune to 5 minutes. Some very nice laid-back chill out style with nice melodies and chords reminding a bit of William Orbit's Strange Cargo albums, hope you like! Get in touch with us! - http://www.huelsbeck.com - http://www.delpriore.de or hit us up on Facebook! Cheers, Fabian aka Rapture[/i]",
