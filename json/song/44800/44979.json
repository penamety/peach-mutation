  "info": "Hey folks, here's my remix of the Ghost Blade main theme, originally composed by Rafael Dyll for the game Ghost Blade. I had much fun to remix it with many details and background stuff going on in the music, along with a powerful spacesynth beat reminding a bit of Laserdance, enjoy! For more info on Ghost Blade, check http://www.facebook.com/HucastGames/ and hit me up at http://www.delpriore.de or on Facebook for a nice talk - Cheers! :) Fabian aka Rapture",
