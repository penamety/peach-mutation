  "info": "[i]Lonely light pole standing alone by the old path. Ancient path through the forbidden forest. Darkness surrounding everywhere. It's so cold, oh it's so cold breathing hurts my lungs.    Skies were clear when I started my journey, now it has been snowing for long I can't even remember how it felt to travel without the white roadblock. Fresh snow makes my determined footsteps disappear behind my back. I really should keep on moving, but the magical shine of light pole has imprisoned me. I really should hurry up and travel through the deserted forest to meet Miss Spring. Then things will be great again.... but just for a while. Composing started January 2018 - Composed with PC Reason by Propellerhead - Greetings to friends <3[/i]",
